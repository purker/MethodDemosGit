  <abstractText>Cloud computing is introducing the next big shift in the IT-industry. It fundamentally changes the IT-strategy of organizations. Cloud computing promises many advantages such as reduced capital expense, support of brief surges in capacity and a better economies of scale [1]. Cloud computing is not only a useful technology for the private sector rather it also can benefit the public sector in many ways [2]. It makes e-government systems faster and cheaper and accelerates the adaptation of use of IT by citizens [3]. Cloud computing is high on the agenda of Obama administration and is being used by federal and local governments with significant benefits [4]. In the European Union the potentials of the Cloud computing have been recognized and the Cloud agenda is being pushed forward, not only because of its cost saving potentials but also because of its impact on the environment. In this work we have conducted a case study for integration of Cloud computing in the Austrian Public sector. The contribution of this work is identification of the requirements of the public sector and obstacles for integration of cloud computing in the Austrian public sector. In this case study eight ministries and the office of chancellor have been interviewed.</abstractText>
