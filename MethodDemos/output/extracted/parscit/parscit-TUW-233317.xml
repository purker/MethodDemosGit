Visual Analytics prototypes increasingly support human sensemak-
ing through providing Provenance information. For data analysts
the challenge of knowledge generation starts with assessing the
quality of a data set, but Provenance is not yet utilized to aid this
task. This position paper aims at characterizing the complexity of
Visual Analytics methods introducing Provenance in Data Quality
by highlighting the challenges of (1) generating Provenance from
Data Quality Control and (2) sensemaking based on Data Quality
Provenance.

1 INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999708608695652">
In Data Quality (DQ) assessment one of the central questions is,
‘Is the Data Quality good enough for analysis to produce meaning-
ful results?’ The quality of data analysis is highly dependent on
the quality of the underlying data. Thus, a prerequisite of any data
analysis, such as creating visualizations and performing analytical
reasoning, is assessing and improving DQ. Data cleansing is an it-
erative task that requires user expertise and domain knowledge of
the data provided [7]. DQ control can be understood as a combina-
tion of data quality assessment, the data cleansing process, as well
as applying transformations to change a data set’s structure. Kandel
et al. [7] argue that integrating interactive and visual systems could
facilitate these tasks as well as data verification.
Yet, the analyst is left with the decision about when quality is
sufficient to start analysis, or if the data is worth further manipulat-
ing at all. Sensemaking is an integral part of Visual Analytics (VA).
During DQ assessment the analyst needs to take into account not
only the actual data, but also implicit information, like how the data
was created or its transformation history. A data set already might
have been analyzed by someone else, generating a transformation
history or other insight. This information could be helpful for fur-
ther analysis. Provenance conceives this information and makes it
available to the data analyst. Establishing a model for sensemaking
to grasp the context of a data set benefits knowledge discovery.

2 CHALLENGES

We reviewed the state-of-the-art of Provenance generation [11],
Provenance in VA [10], as well as sensemaking in VA [1, 13], and
lastly Provenance in DQ assessment [5, 2]. In the following sec-
tions we illustrate our results, i.e., the current VA approaches that
combine DQ with Provenance to aid analysts in their task of making
sense of data. Furthermore we derive open problems and challenges
for Provenance in DQ analysis and contemplate possible solutions.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996052">
2.1 Provenance from Data Quality Control
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99511176">
Data Provenance information is primarily utilized for resolving
conflicting data sets and estimating data reliability based on lin-
eage [3, 14]. Hartig [5] suggests to use a Provenance model in
DQ to assess metrics like accuracy, reliability, or timeliness of data,
which partly conforms with the above mentioned use of conflict
resolution.
However, there are just a few approaches that denote how Prove-
nance information could be used for DQ improvement and assess-
ment. In the following sections we propose approaches to outline
which Provenance information is suited to aid these tasks and how
it should be gathered.
Generating Provenance from Data Cleansing Opera-
tions. Some data analysis tools incorporate the concept of log-
ging the actions of data manipulation [8]. Generating Provenance
from cleansing operations is a promising approach. By now, this
information is merely presented in textual form and used for track-
ing purposes rather than DQ assessment. Provenance information
from data exploration and transformation can be obtained by trac-
ing transformation steps, cleansing operations, etc. in a log for later
inspection.
The Open Provenance Model [11] (OPM) has been developed
to depict Provenance information through an Artifact, Process, and
Agent model. DQ assessment and cleansing operations can be ap-
plied to this model as means of tracking the action history of qual-
ity assessment, employing data sources, similar to artifacts, trans-
formation functions, comparable to processes, and analysts, inter-
pretable as agents. The model’s design is generic enough to support
this task. It provides a good overview of which actions have been
taken by other analysts. However, this approach does not consider
implicit information about data generation sources or information
based on the analyst’s experiences while cleansing operations are
omitted. Thus, it is necessary to either investigate the extensibility
of this model or to find other solutions that are suited to convey this
information.
Generating Provenance from Annotated Data. As a
common way of propagating insightful information to collaborators
or analysts annotations are employed to further analyze the data [9].
They can be seen as a type of Provenance information and allow for
manually adding information about the conditions under which the
data have been created or manipulated. This information is impor-
tant to analysts in order to correctly assess the DQ and to be aware
of all kinds of background information.
Hullman et al. [6] proposed automatically adding narrative an-
notations to line-charts of stock visualizations. They stress the im-
portance of using annotations as an additional information source
to support sensemaking. In existing data analysis approaches anno-
tation is not directly incorporated, but analysts rely on informal in-
formation and consider it in their sensemaking process. We propose
administrating annotations about data sources and quality cleansing
operations as Provenance information.
Generating Provenance from Quality Metrics. In Data
Quality Management one approach to measuring Data Quality is
computing Data Quality Metrics [12] (QM). The aim is to find
structural or measurement errors by means of computation. This
is a task that requires comprehensive knowledge about the error
sources and causes, as well as how they manifest in the data. Met-
rics can be used to both give overview on a data set and simulta-
neously give detailed information on specific values, by being cal-
culated on multiple granularity levels. Errors in the data set are
propagated to high level overviews and can still be easily tracked
by browsing lower aggregation layers.
With quality problems being resolved over time, also the qual-
ity measures improve and indicate a trend during DQ assessment.
We propose utilizing development of the data quality – as indicated
by QM computed at different points in time – as Provenance. We
contemplate that an analyst can determine if the quality is sufficient
for analysis from assessing gradual quality improvement over time,
comparing the current status to the data’s original condition.
We have described approaches to generate Provenance from data
cleansing operations, from annotations, as well as from meta in-
formation based on QM. Logging this information allows their in-
tegration into computation processes and it can be used to deduce
patterns and learn about domain specific traits. Another challenge
is to design means that foster the integration of DQ Provenance into
sensemaking.

2.2 Sensemaking based on Data Quality Provenance
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.856747555555556">
It is not enough to capture Provenance information about DQ, it
also needs to be integrated into sensemaking. Making sense of data
is a highly complex task, which requires the analyst to be aware of
the circumstances under which the data have been generated and by
which contingencies they were influenced. The diversity of Prove-
nance information can be significant. It is necessary to determine
ways of efficiently presenting various types of Provenance informa-
tion to the analyst without obstructing data cleansing operations.
In general, DQ improvement is used to prepare a data set for sub-
sequent analysis. Attfield et al. [1] suggest that analysts aim at gen-
erating a model of sensemaking based on their semantic knowledge
in combination with available information. We identify three itera-
tive phases in the course of DQ assessment and sensemaking where
the analyst combines his/her semantic knowledge with information
about the data set and its respective Provenance information:
(1) The analyst decides if the data is usable, based on the Prove-
nance information that has been provided.
(2) The analyst has a certain goal in mind what to do with the data
in the subsequent analysis and thus he/she transforms and refines
the data to achieve an output that supports sensemaking in this spe-
cific context.
(3) Based on the Provenance information the analyst determines
his/her confidence in the data, and thus, in the analysis results and
interprets the outcome accordingly.
One way of further supporting the sensemkaing process is the
use of efficient visualizations, providing the necessary information
in a suitable format.

Visualizing Provenance from Data Quality Assess-

ment. Provenance for sensemaking in DQ has the potential to
provide substantial additional information to the analyst. It is nec-
essary to develop means of visually propagating this information to
him/her. Analytic Provenance approaches resort to graph- or tree-
like visualization techniques to develop visual representations of
Provenance graphs [5, 13, 10]. Attfield et al. [1] suggest to em-
ploy visualization prototypes to provide indicators that let analysts
hypothesize on the data.
Carata et al. [4] claim that little research has been put into al-
ternative visualization techniques, aside from node-link represen-
tations. We propose novel ideas on how to utilize Provenance
information to generate visual aids in a DQ assessment environ-
ment. Which types of visual aids are suited for this task depends,
of course, on the type of information. QM measure data properties
over time, and are usually normalized. This implies that a contin-
uous multivariate line-chart could properly visualize such informa-
tion and support the decision-making process of the data analyst.
Manual annotations could serve as guiding-points in either data ta-
ble views or in the suggested line-chart visualizations of QM devel-
opment over time, similar to Hullman et al. [6].
We contemplate combining visualizations of different Prove-
nance information types into interactive views that employ linking
and brushing. Within these multiple views annotations could be
used to accentuate significant events and draw conclusions. Pro-
viding such visualizations in addition to Provenance graphs would
provide enriched means for DQ aware data analysis, i.e., different
kinds of visualization for different analysis tasks.
