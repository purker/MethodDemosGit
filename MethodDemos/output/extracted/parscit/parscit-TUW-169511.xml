1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9942575">
Many emergency service providers, especially ambulance departments
and companies who provide non-public maintenance services, face the
problem that their fleet of vehicles has to provide two different types
of services:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97929675">
1. Cover a certain region and provide immediate service when an emer-
gency occurs;
2. Provide some regular service (e.g., the pick-up and delivery of pa-
tients, predetermined service tasks, periodic pick-ups ... ).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999578454545454">
This is the current situation for the largest Austrian emergency ser-
vice providers (e.g., the Austrian Red Cross), where the same fleet is
used to provide both types of services. Dynamic aspects thus directly in-
fluence the schedule for the regular service. When an emergency occurs
and an ambulance is required, the vehicle with the shortest distance
to the emergency is assigned to serve the emergency patient. There-
fore, it may happen that an ambulance vehicle that has to carry out
a scheduled transport order of a patient, which has not started yet, is
used to serve the emergency request and the schedule for the regular
services has to be re-optimized and another vehicle has to be reassigned
to the regular patient. Ambulances that carry out emergency transport

become available at the hospital after the emergency service and can
be then used to carry out regular transport orders. Again, the schedule
for regular services has to be re-optimized.
From the perspective of managing the regular services, the objective
is minimizing the total traveling distance subject to certain restrictions
(e.g., be on time). From the perspective of minimizing the response
time for servicing an emergency request, it is necessary to locate and
schedule the vehicles in such a way that each possible location where an
emergency case may occur can be reached within a given time (see [4]).
These two objectives are not totally contradictory, but they cer-
tainly conflict: on the one hand, for the emergency transport requests,
one has to account for the fact that vehicles are changing positions
and are blocked for some time due to some regular service assignment;
on the other hand, when regular orders are assigned to vehicles, it is
important to keep a certain coverage level to ensure a satisfactory ser-
vice of the emergency cases, which may require relocating some of the
vehicles.
Emergency service providers thus want to find a robust solution for
a specific day of the week in order to minimize routing costs, as well as
the response time for servicing emergency patients, taking into account
that the two types of the transportation services have to be realized
with a single fleet.
Some related work has been published where pickup and delivery
requests occur dynamically (see [1, 3, 6]). Note that in our case only
emergency orders occur dynamically. The nearest empty vehicle is used
to serve the emergency immediately. Since subsequent scheduled reg-
ular transport requests on the redirected vehicle are not covered any
more, a re-optimization step is initiated.
In order to study different dispatch strategies for the real world
patient transportation problem, we need a simple, fast and effective
solution procedure. Hence, we implemented a constructive heuristic
approach. In the construction phase, we exploit the temporal structure
of the requests and use a nearest neighbor measure inspired by [5]. The
main challenge is to deal with the dynamic nature of the problem, which
implies that new solutions can be calculated in very short time. Every
time a new emergency request occurs, the distance information for the
empty vehicles has to be updated in order to identify very quickly the
next empty vehicle to the emergency request. Then, one has to resolve
the remaining problem with one less vehicle available to serve the reg-
ular orders. When an emergency order is fulfilled and the patient has
been unloaded at the hospital, an additional vehicle is made available
Waiting Strategies for Patient Transportation Problems 3
and it can be used to fulfill regular patient transportation orders. When
this situation occurs, the schedule for the regular transport orders has
also to be re-optimized to take advantage of this additional vehicle to
improve the objective function.
To evaluate the solution quality various scenarios have to be calcu-
lated. In the evaluation of the different scenarios, vehicle movements
and the spatial distribution of empty vehicles are monitored over time.
The distance matrix is also updated whenever an emergency request
occurs.

2 Problem Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.953172">
In our study we consider a combination of two problems
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999814">
• the Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) for regular patient transportation
and
• dispatching ambulance vehicles for emergency cases.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999921583333334">
In the classical DARP, a set of requests announced beforehand are
served from a single depot. These requests have hard time windows
and a preferred pickup or delivery time. In the problem of dispatching
ambulance vehicles for emergency cases, one must ensure short response
times in a dynamic environment. The regular patient transportation
problem can be considered to be a variation of DARP with additional
real world constraints regarding customer preferences or requirements.
A comprehensive description of the DARP is given in [2].
Each transport order or request incorporates a pickup location and
a delivery location. For each transportation request a time window and
a service or loading time for each pickup and delivery location is given.
Concerning time windows, we have two different situations - on the one
hand, patients should be picked-up as late as possible from their home
when they are being transported to hospitals (outbound request); on
the other hand, patients should be picked-up as early as possible when
they are transported from the hospital back home (inbound request).
Time window violations are not allowed and deviations from the de-
sired pick-up and drop-off times within the specified time window are
considered in the objective function.
Time windows for each request are defined either by a desired de-
livery time for outbound requests or a desired pickup time for inbound
requests. The resulting time window is calculated by allowing an early
pickup or an early delivery by 30 minutes. The pickup or delivery has
to be performed within this time window. We allow also a maximum

<bodyText confidence="0.999970705882353">
ride time for each passenger. This maximum ride time is defined for
each customer by calculating the shortest path from the pickup to the
delivery location and allowing an additional ride time of 30 minutes. In
our computational tests the vehicle capacity is two, therefore the max-
imum number of patients that can be transported at the same time is
two. Waiting is not allowed with a passenger on board.
In our real world problem for the regular patients it is desired to
minimize transportation costs and to maximize quality of service for
patients. And for the emergency patients it is desired to minimize re-
sponse time for emergency requests.
In the objective function for the constructive procedure the reg-
ular patients (transportation costs, quality of service) are considered
whereas the response time minimization is considered in the different
waiting strategies. Quality of service for the regular transport orders is
measured by the deviation of the preferred delivery time for the out-
bound request and the deviation of the preferred pickup time for the
inbound request respectively.

3 Dynamic aspects
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986152379310345">
After computing a solution for the problem at hand using one of the
proposed solution procedures, improving the coverage criterion is possi-
ble without changing the solution structure. More precisely, movements
of vehicles may be delayed or pushed forward in time while the sequence
of transport requests on each tour remains unchanged.
The distribution is measured at discrete points in time for all empty
vehicles, e.g., at equal intervals from the first pick-up to the last drop-
off during the day or optimization period. Besides the empty vehicle
positions, we use a set of equidistant raster points in the respective
area. The covered raster points by the empty vehicles within a certain
radius are calculated and used as a proxy for the response time.
Therefore, we distinguish four different waiting strategies to influ-
ence movements of empty vehicles on their way from a delivery lo-
cation to the next pickup location. The first two strategies are static
ones called ’early arrival’ and ’late arrival’. Early arrival means, that
a vehicle departs to its next pickup location immediately after deliv-
ering the last patient and waits at the pickup location until the next
pickup starts. On the contrary, late arrival means, that a vehicle waits
at the last delivery location just as long as possible to arrive at the
next pickup location in time.
Waiting Strategies for Patient Transportation Problems 5
The last two strategies are dynamic variants of the former ones,
which use late arrival or early arrival as default, but may change the
strategy for each single request if an individual coverage calculation
indicates an improvement. For each single request both coverage values
(late and early arrival) are calculated. The strategy with the better
global coverage is performed. Note that potential movements of other
vehicles while the respective vehicle drives from delivery to pickup lo-
cation are not considered in this proxy evaluation.

4 Evaluation of the approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984966666667">
In order to test the solution procedures with a comprehensive set of
parameters and emergency instances, a simulation environment for the
problem at hand was implemented. The efficiency of the solution proce-
dures was evaluated with real world data from the city of Graz provided
by the Austrian Red Cross. We used 15 problem instances with a num-
ber of regular transport requests ranging from 152 to 286 and grouped
them into three classes of five instances each. The small instances en-
counter from 152 to 192, the medium instances from 200 to 220 and the
large instances from 260 to 286 transport requests. All requests occur
after 6:00 a.m. and before 5:00 p.m. and for each outbound request a
corresponding inbound request occurs a few hours later.
In the computational studies, we evaluated the impact of different
waiting strategies as described above. Hence, we evaluated response
times to artifical emergency transport requests for a large number of
runs. For each instance and each waiting strategy we measured re-
sponse times for three randomly distributed emergency requests over
2000 independent runs. In Table 1 we report average response time,
maximum response time and coverage for each instance class as well as
for each waiting strategy. The improvements of the dynamic strategies
compared to the static counterpart are reported in the last two rows of
the tables (imp.).
The results show that the dynamic strategies outperform the static
ones, whereas early arrival generally performs better than late arrival.
The average response time using early arrival strategy can be reduced
from 5.04 to 5.01 minutes. Also the maximum response time in the
case of early arrivals can be reduced from 7.87 minutes to 7.83 min-
utes. The improved coverage enables these improvements. By using a
dynamic waiting strategy the coverage can be improved e.g. for the
early arrival strategy by 1.65 %. Improvements from the static to the
dynamic strategies are remarkably higher for late arrival.
