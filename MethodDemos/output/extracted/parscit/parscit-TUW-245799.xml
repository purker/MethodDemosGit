Basic Concepts in the Diagnosis of Traffic Safety In-
stallations Using Fuzzy Logic Based Models
</title>
<bodyText confidence="0.9985401">
The diagnosis of failures in train traffic installations can be done in sev-
eral ways: direct observations and measurements, software assisted
diagnosis using specific software packages, process variable monitoring
for electronically centralized installations. This work presents basic con-
cepts for Model Based Diagnosis (MBD) that uses fuzzy logic to analyse
the integrity of Centralized Traffic Control Installations (CTC) in train
traffic. We define the diagnosis relations to be used and show how to
apply them to train traffic security installations. Implementing these
concepts into an expert system assists maintenance operators in quick
failure diagnosis of the train traffic security installations.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9974946875">
Railroad Centralized Traffic Control installations are very complex systems that
command and control train traffic, being essential in train traffic security. Train
stations where the CTC installation is electro-dynamically realised (ED-CTC) have
more complex subsystems, each of them, again, having subcomponents that inter-
act with each other. Each subsystem interacts with other subsystems, therefore
the safety of the traffic passing an ED-CTC station is ensured when all subsystems
function within normal parameter values.
Fig. 1 shows the interconnection block schema for a railway station with CTC
and ABS (Automatic Block Signalling) installations.
All subsystems are controlled through the command console, any failure of
the one or more subsystem causing an irregular behaviour of the whole system,
behaviour which is usually signalled. Diagnosing the system or the subsystem is
necessary in order to detect the failing component(s) that are the cause of the
faulty behaviour.
Currently, for these types of installations, the failure diagnosis is done by di-
rect observations of the various signals and measurements of equipment states.

The diagnosis time strongly depends on the maintenance staff’s detailed knowl-
edge on the whole system and subsystems internals.

This work proposes to develop an expert system (ES) that uses fuzzy logic to
diagnose CTC stations. ESs are used also in power electric systems [1].
The expert system will receive information from various subsystem compo-
nents and will process and compare them with the ES model. The ES output will be
a minimal set of causes for the signalled system misbehaviour, corresponding to
the signals displayed.

2. Principles of the Model Based Diagnosis
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994261875">
To better understand the basic principles in the model based diagnosis we will
use the word system to refer to both systems and subsystems.
To use the model based diagnosis it is necessary to completely describe each
system component. This step is called system description, SD [1,2]. Logical rela-
tions that describe how the components work, the links between components, and
the workings of the whole system are established. These relations are, in fact,
propositional logic sentences that form the system’s propositional logic, SPL.
A logical consequence of the detailed and correct system description is the
correct operation of the system. Any discrepancy between the system’s punctual
behaviour (pointwise) and its description is caused by a faulty component. Thus
the system description is based on the logical propositions that describe the com-
ponents, their operation and the links between them.
To diagnose a system we must identify all the discrepancies between the sys-
tem description and its running behaviour. Each discrepancy (or symptom) is de-
termined by a set of concurrent components, CC, which are candidate components
for the respective symptom. We can write:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.908954">
328
</page>
<equation confidence="0.969122">
CC ⊃ CD (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999739375">
An example of a defect, in our case, is the fact that an entry signal cannot be
commanded on the ‘free’ position. The concurrent components of this symptom
are: damaged track circuit, damaged track point, faulty power feed installation,
line occupied by rolling stock, previously executed movement on the same line,
damaged command apparatus. Based on observations it is noted that the system
failure is caused by the track circuit which does not function properly. In this case
the main candidate components are: safeties, transformers, IMVS, BDF, TR relays,
the track relay, the filter, the railway tracks, connections, ropes (Fig. 2).
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.996518">
Figure 2. Concurrent and candidate components
</figureCaption>
<equation confidence="0.569326">
In our example, then, we have: (2)
CC = { Switch point, Signal, ABS,...Track circuit}
CD = { Transformers, Safeties, Rail track,..., relay IMVS}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.935106333333333">
The faults in the track circuit operations are caused by the breakdown of one or
more candidate components in the CD set.
We continue with some further basic definitions and relations in the model
based diagnosis systems.
The CD’s operation state is described by a predicate, AB, which indicates the
abnormal operation (faulty state). The normal operation state is given by ¬AB [2].

- SD is a finite subset of system’s propositional logic, SPL.
The system diagnosis, ∆, is applied when the following holds:
SD ∪ CD ≠ FS (4)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.991117">
Using the AB predicate we can describe the components’ functional proper-
ties. Suppose we want to express the following sentence: “Normally, the NF1-800
operating voltage is between 8 V and 12 V” [3]. Then, the corresponding relation
is:

nents with the relation:

<equation confidence="0.652013">
type (CD)∧AB(CD)⊃ fault1 (CD)∨ fault2 (CD) ∨ ... ∨ faultn (CD) (6)

The knowledge base is loaded from the database of system elements. These rules are processed by the inference engine that uses fuzzy logic operators [6]. - The user interface where the conflict sets are displayed. In this work we show an expert system designed to diagnose a CTC type CR4 installation, on a track section with ABS installations. Fig. 4 </context>
