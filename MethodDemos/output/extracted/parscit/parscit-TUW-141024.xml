Clinical practice guidelines are widely used to support medical staff in treatment planning and
decision-making, whereas, the classification of different recommendations in the CPGs are one of
the most important information sources to use. However, there is a lack of consensus amongst guide-
line developers, regarding those classification schemes. To address this problem, we mapped the
different graded and ungraded evidence information used by different guideline developing organi-
zations into our meta schema. In this paper we describe how guideline representation languages,
such as Asbru and PROforma can be extended to model our meta schema.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999862821428571">
Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are one of the central topics of research in Artifical In-
telligence in medicine. They can be described as ”systematically developed statements to assist
practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances”
[3]. The major goal of CPGs is to support physicians in their daily work providing information
needed for the decision-making process for a particular patient and disease. We can say that rec-
ommendations described in CPGs are one of the most important information sources to use during
decision-making, because they provide phycisians various treatment options.
Recommendations are, in general, based on some kind of evidence, represented by different
levels of evidence (LoEs), and on strengths of recommendations (SoRs). Several definitions of
LoEs and SoRs exist by now. In the context of our work, the following definitions seem appropriate
[2]:
Levels of evidence (LoEs): The validity of an individual study is based on an assessment of
its study type. According to some methodologies, LoEs can refer not only to individual studies
but also to the quality of evidence from multiple studies about a specific question or the quality of
evidence supporting a clinical intervention.
Strengths of recommendation (SoRs): The SoRs for clinical practice is based on a body of
evidence. This approach takes into account the LoEs of individual studies, the type of outcomes
measured by these studies, the number, consistency, and coherence of the evidence as a whole, the
relationship between benefits, harms, and costs.
However, in addition to such graded recommendations, there also exist ungraded recommen-
dations, where the guidelines do not contain any classification of the LoEs or SoRs. They usu-
ally appear in guidelines as ordinary text fragments. This circumstance makes the classification
of ungraded evidence information a challenging task. Such a classification is necessary, because
evidence-based recommendations, that are classified recommendations, are better followed in prac-
tice than recommendations not based on any scientific evidence [6].
Hence, the aim is to present evidence information of CPGs in computer-interpretable form. Such
a representation allow guideline users and modellers to embed the evidence information in several
methods and tools and support the decision-making process.

2. Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999843714285714">
In order to facilitate the decision-making process, several guideline representation languages and
systems have been developed. They provide physicians a computer interpretable representation of
guidelines to enable automated decision-making support. However, LoEs and SoRs are inadequatly
treated in guideline representation languages and tools, as they do not support the formalising and
modeling process of recommendations with regard to the LoEs and SoRs sufficiently. They need to
be extended to provide means for representing evidence information in CPGs. Therefore, a method
is required to extend these guideline representation languages with the evidence information in
computer-supported guidelines.
Guideline representation languages with well-structured syntax and semantics, such as Asbru
[9] and PROforma [4] are of particular importance, because they have been developed to handle
various concepts that care formalisation implies. Many guideline modelling tools (e.g., AsbruView,
Tallis) are based on these languages. Our proposed extensions can be embedded into the syntax and
semantic of these languages so that such tools can provide a computer-interpretable representation
of the evidence information in CPGs. Hence, we decided to use Asbru and PROforma to model the
evidence information according to our meta schema.
Asbru is a time-oriented, intention-based representation language to represent CPGs and clinical
protocols in XML. It is used to represent guidelines in a set of hierarchical skeletal plans. Each plan
consists of a name, a set of arguments, a time annotation, preferences, intentions, conditions, effects,
and a plan body (for more detail consider [9, 8]). The preferences are of particular importance to
us, because they describe the resource constraints, the costs, and the responsible actor. Our meta
schema will be embedded into the definitions of preferences.
PROforma is a guideline representation language to support the management of medical pro-
cedures as well as decision systems. It provides a basis for a method, a technology and different
applications for developing and publishing executeable CPGs. A guideline application is modeled
as a set of tasks and data items. The four basis classes are (1) plan, (2) decision, (3) action, and
(4) enquiry (compare [11]). In order to embed the evidence information into the PROforma syntax
we focused on the decision task, because this task is responsible for the decision-making process
during execution.

3. The way to the meta schema
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973707317073">
We already stressed out the importance of a formal representation of evidence information in
CPGs and analysed 21 CPGs developed by nine different organizations and co-operations. We
manually extracted the data needed to embed the evidence information in CPGs into the representa-
tion languages Asbru and PROforma. The extracted data included information about the guideline
developing organization (GDOs), LoEs, SoRs, trade-off between benefits and harms, and costs (for
more detail compare [7]).
Guideline developing organizations (GDOs): is essential to extract from and differentiate be-
tween the different grading systems. For example, the Finnish Medical Society Duodecim (FMSD)
uses the letter A to grade a LoEs, whereas the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma Workshop
Group (ARIA) uses the letter A to classify the SoRs.
Levels of evidence (LoEs): Our meta schema takes various types of medical studies into con-
sideration and defines for each type of study different LoEs, indicating the quality of evidence on
which the study is based. In order to get a hierarchical structure, we defined the LoEs on the basis
of the study types, where meta-analysis is on the top and no study type at the bottom of the hierar-
chy. The type of a study is of particular importance to us, because it is going to be used to assign
grades to ungraded evidence information. Classification system is important to establish a relation
between the study type and the quality of evidence the study is based on. Therefore, we introduce
our own labels (e.g., I 3, II 6) that consists of a Roman numeral indicating the type of study and
a number indicating the quality of evidence the study is based on, separated by an underscore (for
more detail see [7] ). This classification system will be used to formalize our meta schema and to
extend the guideline representation languages Asbru and PROforma.
Strengths of recommendations (SoRs): In most of the CPGs (16 guidelines out of 21) we
considered, the SoRs are not explicitly represented. In the remaining five guidelines, different
labels are used to refer to SoRs. Therefore, we developed our own meta schema for SoRs, which
is compatible with the ones used in those five guidelines. It was clear that the SoRs have to be
distinguishable, meaningful, clear, and unambiguous. We thought that more than four hierarchical
levels would not satisfy these objectives and defined levels of strength as (1)strong recommendation,
(2)recommendation, (3)weak recommendation, and (4)no recommendation.
Benefits and harms: Often CPGs contain texts about the benefits and possible harms of a partic-
ular treatment. The CPGs we used do not contain any information about the trade-off between the
benefits and harms either. They only contain a common description of known benefits and harms.
We used the well defined categorization by the GRADE working group as a basis for defining our
meta schema for representing the trade-off between benefits and harms, because tehy suggest to in-
clude explicit information about the balance between the main health benefits of a treatment while
considering its costs, as they may play a significant role during the decision-making process (see
[1]). We want this attribute to be included in the guideline representation languages.
Costs: CPGs have been developed to improve the quality of health care, while reducing avoid-
able costs for providing this health care. Therefore, it is important that guideline users are informed
about the potential costs and expected outcomes of different choices regarding the treatment. This
information allows users to prioritize different options for treatment according to their value and
cost-effectiveness [5].

4. Extension of Asbru and PROforma
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966349764705883">
In Section 3 we gave an overview of the basic attributes of evidence information we think to be
mandatory when it is aimed to enable better support of physicians while decision-making. Now, we
want to explain how they can be represented in the guideline representation languages Asbru and
PROforma and how these languages have to be extended. In the following we summarise and name
the seven attributes we propose:
scientific conclusion: is the main attribute representing the overall result
organization: represents the name of the guideline developing organization
levels of evidence: contains the labels that refer to the type of study and the quality of its evidence
(e.g., II 2, IV 3)
study type: gives information about the concrete type of study (e.g., cohort study, etc.)
strength: represents the stregnth of recommendation (e.g., strong recommendation)
benefit harm: refers to the trade-off between benefits and harms of a treatment (only if available
in the CPG)
costs: provides information about the costs of a particular treatment (only if available in the CPG)
The attributes organization, study type, strength, level of evidence, and scientific conclusion are
essential, whereas benefit harm and costs are optional. Because Asbru and PROforma have their
own syntax, it is necessary to propose the extension to both languages separately.

<bodyText confidence="0.99988275">
As Asbru is an XML-based language, we defined a Document Type Definition (DTD) that de-
scribes the use of our proposed seven attributes to formally represent evidence information in Asbru.
The attribute scientific conclusion has to be included into the element preferences, which is a child
of the plan element containing various information used in the plan selection phase (compare [8]).

patient’s discomfort will be at a low level [8].

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925176470588">
To evaluate the motivation to our meta schema, the grading schema itself, and the proposed
extensions to Asbru and PROforma, we composed a questionnaire of ten questions. They were
about the correctness, feasibility, and understandability of, the hierarchical structure of our meta
schema, the proposed LoEs and SoRs, the mappings between existing grading schemes and our
schema, the attribute representing the trade-off between benefits and harms, and the assignment of
our LoEs and SoRs to ungraded evidence information. We also formulated questions regarding the
availability of needed information for the proposed attributes, the expected extent of facilitation of
the decison-making process when using our grading schema, and the representability of our schema
with regard to existing grading schemes.
We sent this questionnaire to 29 persons including guideline developers, physicians, and devel-
opers of guideline representation languages. Most of them agreed with the correctness, understand-
ability, and sensibility of the hierarchical structure, the quality of the LoEs and the SoRs, and the
mapping tables for our schema. Some of them disagreed with the assignment of the SoRs to the
ungraded evidence information. They believe that more information is needed than the LoEs and
the SoRs to support a correct decision. We took all received answers into consideration to update
our grading schema and representations, which yield to the enhanced version of our grading schema
that we presented in this work.

6. Conclusion and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9981513125">
Our meta schema connects different schemes of LoEs and SoRs and provides a means to assign
a LoE and a SoR to ungraded evidence recommendations based on the study type and quality of
evidence if available. The meta schema provides a possibility to handle the multitude of grading
systems on an equal level and facilitates the flow of the underlying information to be quickly and
traceable. Additionally, evidence information about a particular recommendation provides guide-
line users the facility to choose between recommendations with high level and recommendations
with lower level during decision-making. In this paper, we presented two extensions to the guideline
representation languages Asbru and PROforma, to enable them to represent evidence information
according to our proposed meta schema. We think that these extensions are essential to facilitate
the decision-making process in computer-based medical treatment planning.
For the near future, our focus is on enhancing our meta schema in order to apply it to guidelines
from other domains (e.g., cancer) and on developing Information Extraction methods that are able
to (semi-) automatically extract evidence information in CPGs according to our proposed meta
schema.
