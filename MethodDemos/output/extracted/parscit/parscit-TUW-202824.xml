Abstract— Cloud computing is introducing the next big shift
in the IT-industry. It fundamentally changes the IT-strategy of
organizations. Cloud computing promises many advantages such
as reduced capital expense, support of brief surges in capacity and
a better economies of scale [1]. Cloud computing is not only a
useful technology for the private sector rather it also can benefit
the public sector in many ways [2]. It makes e-government systems
faster and cheaper and accelerates the adaptation of use of IT by
citizens [3]. Cloud computing is high on the agenda of Obama
administration and is being used by federal and local governments
with significant benefits [4]. In the European Union the potentials
of the Cloud computing have been recognized and the Cloud
agenda is being pushed forward, not only because of its cost saving
potentials but also because of its impact on the environment.
In this work we have conducted a case study for integration of
Cloud computing in the Austrian Public sector. The contribution of
this work is identification of the requirements of the public sector
and obstacles for integration of cloud computing in the Austrian
public sector. In this case study eight ministries and the office of
chancellor have been interviewed.
The most important requirements of the Austrian public sector can
be summarized as follows:
- Legal compliance: The most important factor for the
public sector is legal compliance. E.g. the Austrian and
European laws require that data remain within the
borders of the European Union.
- Reliability: The public sector policies are long-term. It
must be ensured that any Cloud solution and provider
exists in the coming 10-20 years.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.873336111111111">
- Availability: The Austrian public sector requires that its
services be available at least from 7 AM to 7 PM MET.
In case of the Austrian ministry of foreign affairs from 7
AM to 7 PM local time.
- Compatibility and connectivity: Any Cloud solution
must be compatible with already available in-house
solutions. Each ministry runs its own in-house servers.
- Scalability: Services must be scalable enough such that
citizens can also be served in peak times.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999191903225806">
The obstacles for integration of Cloud computing in the Austrian
Public sector can be summarized as follows:
- Data security and privacy: This is the biggest challenge.
Putting the private data of citizens in the hand of third
party service providers is very sensitive.
- Network security: Ministries and organizations within
the Austrian public sector are connected through
Corporate Network Austria (CAN). Within this trusted
network authentication and data transport security is not
a major concern. Cloud computing poses a
fundamentally new challenge as Internet cannot be
regarded as a trusted network.
- Lack of knowledge about available systems: Each
department runs its own applications. Many concurrent
technologies and operating systems run in parallel.
Acquiring knowledge about the current state and used
technologies is a tedious task.
- Previous investments: The public sector has invested
heavily in IT-infrastructure. Migration of available
solutions onto cloud makes previous investments
unneeded.
- Business continuity: Because of lack of interoperability
between cloud providers, moving between cloud
providers is almost impossible. IT-strategist in the public
sector state the concern what if a cloud provider goes out
of business and it is impossible to move to another cloud
provider.
In conclusion, security and privacy is the biggest challenge for the
integration of Cloud computing in the Austrian public sector. A
possible solution would be a cloud run by the European
Commission itself that hosts applications of the member states.
