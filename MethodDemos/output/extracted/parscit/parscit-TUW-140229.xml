<bodyText confidence="0.999842875">
Detecting the needs of learners is a challenging but
essential task to be able to provide adaptivity. In this
paper we present a tool that enables learning
management systems (LMS) to detect learning styles
based on the behavior of learners during an online
course. By calculating the learning styles and filling
the student model of LMS with such personal data, a
basis for adaptivity is provided.

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999866434782609">
Learning management systems (LMS) are very
successful in e-education but provide only little
adaptivity [1]. Adapting courses to the needs of
individual learners, e.g. to their learning styles,
improves the learning progress of learners. However, a
requirement for providing adaptivity is to know the
needs of learners.
Regarding learning styles, there exist
comprehensive questionnaires to detect learning styles.
Moreover, tracking features are available in most LMS
which track and store the behavior of learners during
all courses. This data shows what learners really do
and prefer in a course. Instead of asking learners about
their preferences by using a questionnaire, we propose
an approach to infer the learning style from the
behavior of the learners (Section 2). The developed
tool (Section 3) incorporates that different LMS use
different database schemata and track different
information. Based on the available information, the
tool calculates the learning styles. This information can
act as a basis to provide adaptivity in LMS.
Related work deals with the identification of
learning styles in adaptive systems such as

MASPLANG [2] and CS383 [3]. But these systems
use a questionnaire for detecting learning styles.
Garcia et al. [4] investigated the use of Bayesian
networks to detect learning styles based on the
behavior of learners in a web-based educational
system. While their work is focused on the use of
Bayesian networks, our approach sums up indications
of preferences based on patterns, equally to the
approach of learning style questionnaires. Moreover,
we propose a tool for LMS in general rather than for
one specific system.

2. Patterns of behavior
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993631067961">
Our work is based on the Felder-Silverman learning
style model (FSLSM) [5]. While there are several
learning style theories, FSLSM seems to be most
appropriate for the use in educational systems. Most
other learning style models classify learners in few
groups, whereas Felder and Silverman describe the
learning style of a learner in more detail, distinguishing
between preferences on four dimensions
(active/reflective, sensing/intuitive, visual/verbal, and
sequential/global). Therefore, each learner has a
preference for each of these four dimensions. Another
main issue is that FSLSM is based on tendencies,
saying that also learners with a high preference for a
certain behavior can sometimes act differently.
Detecting learning styles is done by detecting
patterns that indicate a preference for a specific
dimension. Because FSLSM is based on learning in
general, for detecting learning styles in LMS the
general behavior is mapped to behavior in LMS.
Furthermore, it needs to be considered that different
LMS have different features available. Therefore, we
concentrated on commonly used features like content
objects, examples, tests, exercises, forums, and chats.
Active learners are characterized as learners who
prefer to process information actively by doing
something with the learned material, e.g. discussing it,
explaining it, or testing it. Regarding discussing and
explaining, communication facilities like forums or
chats are commonly used elements and a high number
of visits in a forum or a chat as well as a high number
of postings in both indicate an active learning style.
Regarding the preference for testing and
experimenting, we consider the use of exercises,
incorporating the number of visits and the time a
learner deals with exercises. Reflective learners, on the
other hand, prefer to think about the learned material.
Therefore, they tend to spend more time on reading
material like content objects and examples. These
patterns indicate reflective behavior.
Sensing learners favor concrete material like facts
and data whereas intuitive learners prefer to learn
abstract material such as theories and their underlying
meaning. Analyzing the performance on questions
about theories/concepts and facts gives us therefore an
indication of the preferred learning style. Another
characteristic of sensing learners is that they are more
patient with details and work carefully but slowly.
Because they tend to check their answers carefully
before delivering a test, another pattern is the number
of revisions performed before handing in a test. Also
the time taken for a test is considered as a pattern.
Because intuitive learners welcome challenges, the
number and time spent on exercises serves as a pattern.
On the other hand, sensing learners favor to check
their already acquired knowledge by self-assessment
tests. Therefore, the amount of performed tests is a
further pattern. To make concepts and theories more
concrete, sensing learners prefer examples. Thus, the
visits and time spent on examples serve as other
patterns.
Verbal learners like communication and
discussions. Therefore, they tend to commonly use the
forum and chat. Thus, a high number of visits and
postings in forum and chat indicate a verbal learning
style. Visual learners learn best from what they can
see. Therefore, the time spent on content objects with
graphics can be used as pattern for visual learners.
Furthermore, learners who perform well in questions
about graphics can also be considered as visual
learners.
Sequential learners are more comfortable with
details, whereas global learners tend to be good in
seeing the “big picture” and connections to other
fields. Therefore, the performance on answered
questions dealing with overviews of concepts or
connections between concepts and questions about
details serves as one pattern for this dimension.
Another pattern deals with the performance on tests in
general. According to Felder and Silverman, sequential
learners perform better in tests than global learners.
Because global learners are interested in getting the
“big picture” and an overview, outlines of the course
and chapters are especially important for them. A high
number of visits and more time spent on such outlines
indicate a global learning style. The navigation of
learners in a course acts also as a pattern denoting a
sequential or global learning style. While sequential
learners tend to go through the course step by step in a
linear way, global learners learn in large leaps,
sometimes skipping learning objects and jumping to
more complex material. As a pattern we analyzed the
behavior of skipping learning objects in the course.
Furthermore, the number of visits of the course
overview page as well as the time spent on this page is
considered. This page shows all learning objects of the
course and can be used by global learners to get an
overview of the course material.
Because each of these patterns gives an indication
of a specific learning style, the learning style can be
also calculated if some patterns can not be tracked by
the LMS or some elements are not used in the course.
However, the more patterns included in the
calculation, the more stable the result.

<bodyText confidence="0.9995588">
In this section we present a tool for detecting
learning styles based on the behavior of learners in
LMS. The architecture of the tool and its components
can be seen in Figure 1 and are described in the
following.

3.1 Data extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977962962963">
Because the tool is developed to detect learning
styles in LMS in general rather than in one specific
system, we have to incorporate that different LMS use
different database schemata. Therefore, we need to
build a global schema. This can be done by a bottom-
up approach, using one LMS database schema as a
basis, or by a top-down approach, where the required
information acts as a basis. Because LMS databases
can include much more information than we need for
detecting learning styles, and database schemata from
different LMS have quite different structures, the top-
down approach is applied. Therefore, each table of the
global schema includes data representing one pattern.
To keep the extraction process as simple as
possible, the representation of the data in each table is
based on the event-based way data are stored in LMS
databases. For example, a table includes data about
each visit of a learner in a forum. How often a learner
actually visited the forum is then calculated
automatically by the tool.
For supporting the teacher in specifying the location
of the required information for the global schema, an
editor is provided. For each pattern, names for required
tables and attributes, possible constraints, as well as
necessary information for connecting tables are
specified. Additionally, it is possible to write an SQL
statement instead of using the question-based editor.

3.2 Calculation of learning styles
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998312">
In the calculation component ordered data are
calculated from the raw data delivered by the data
extraction component. Subsequently, learning styles
are calculated for each dimension based on the ordered
data.
Ordered data for each pattern can take the values
+1, 0, and -1, indicating e.g. an active, balanced, or
reflective preference. For building these data out of the
raw data, thresholds for all patterns need to be
determined. As is argued e.g. in [6] and [7], these
thresholds can vary from course to course depending
e.g. on the structure of the course and the subject.
Therefore, the proposed tool recommends thresholds
which can be changed by teachers if necessary. These
thresholds are based on other research work dealing
with the usage of the respective features [4][8][9].
The calculation of learning styles itself is based on
the approach used in the Index of Learning Styles
(ILS) [10], a questionnaire for identifying the learning
style according to FSLSM. According to this approach,
for each dimension the ordered data (+1, 0, or -1)
which are relevant for the respective dimension are
summed up. The result of each dimension is converted
to a 3-item scale, indicating e.g. an active, balanced, or
reflective learning style.

4. Conclusion and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934">
This paper presented a tool for detecting learning
styles based on the behavior of learners in learning
management systems. Based on the Felder-Silverman
learning style model, suitable patterns of behavior
indicating specific learning styles in LMS were
derived. Because the tool is designed for different
LMS, data extraction issues are incorporated and
teachers are supported in providing the location of
required information.
While the approach of detecting learning styles is
based on literature, future work deals with an
evaluation of the tool where results of the ILS
questionnaire will be compared with the results of the
proposed tool.
