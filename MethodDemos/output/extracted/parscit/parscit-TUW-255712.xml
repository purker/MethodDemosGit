Abstract argumentation is a rich research subfield of AI and
till today, numerous frameworks for it have been proposed.
It is thus natural to ask whether one can translate between
these structures, and what are the price and consequences of
undergoing this process. Although every study explains how
a given structure relates to the cornerstone of abstract argu-
mentation – Dung’s framework – there are less results avail-
able concerning the connections between more advanced for-
malisms. Moreover, the existing research is not particularly
systematized or classified in a way that would clearly show
us the properties of a given transformation. In our work, we
address these issues by creating an in–depth compendium on
the intertranslatability of argumentation frameworks, describ-
ing approximately eighty translations. Furthermore, we pro-
vide a system for analyzing a given transformation in terms
of its functional, syntactical, semantical and computational
properties and the underlying methodology.
Over the last years, argumentation has become an influen-
tial subfield of artificial intelligence, with applications rang-
ing from legal reasoning (Bench-Capon, Prakken, and Sartor
2009) to dialogues and persuasion (McBurney and Parsons
2009; Prakken 2009) to medicine (Fox et al. 2010; Hunter
and Williams 2012) to eGovernment (Atkinson, Bench-
Capon, and McBurney 2006). Within it, we can distinguish
the abstract argumentation approaches, at the heart of which
lies Dung’s argumentation framework (Dung 1995). Since
the structure itself was relatively limited, as it took into ac-
count only the conflict relation between the arguments, it
inspired the search for more general models (Brewka, Pol-
berg, and Woltran 2014). Throughout the years, many of its
extensions were proposed, ranging from the ones employ-
ing various strengths and preferences to those that focus
on researching new types of relations between arguments
(Baroni et al. 2011; Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex 2013;
Nielsen and Parsons 2007; Nouioua 2013; Polberg and Oren
2014; Brewka and Woltran 2010; Amgoud and Vesic 2011;
Bench-Capon 2003; Modgil 2009).
Such an amount of frameworks should not come as a sur-
prise. Argumentation is a wide area with numerous applica-
tions, in which one has to face different classes of problems.
Frameworks of a given type can be seen as tools to model
particular issues and concepts, which on one side gives us
more insight into how to approach the problems, but on the
other affects the framework’s design. Nevertheless, with so
many available structures, it is only natural to ask whether
one can translate one framework into another, and what are
the price and consequences of undergoing this process.
The ability to transform one framework into another is
both of theoretical and practical value. The majority of the
existing formalisms does not have a dedicated solver. There-
fore, a translation into one that does, such as Dung’s frame-
work or abstract dialectical framework (Egly, Gaggl, and
Woltran 2010; Ellmauthaler and Strass 2014), can facili-
tate the development of argumentation–based applications.
Moreover, if our purpose is to solve a variety of problems for
which different frameworks are suitable, translations would
allow us to choose the most adequate one to work “in the
background”.
Our study can be seen as more research–oriented. The be-
havior of the semantics and what structural changes a frame-
work has to undergo gives us an insight into how e.g. a given
relation between arguments works and how it can or can-
not be simulated by other concepts. For example, we can try
to transform one form of support into another, support into
attack or preference into an argument. However, the abil-
ity to perform a conversion is one thing; what is also im-
portant is the price we need to pay for it, and by this we
do not mean just the computational cost of the process. De-
pending on how intrusive the modifications are, our source
framework can be represented in a way that it is no longer
possible to retrieve the original structure from it. We can
be forced to assume some structure of arguments, drop or
add – possibly exponentially many – elements of the frame-
work. As a result, we can reach a point in which propagating
the change in the source structure to the target one can be-
come nearly impossible without repeating the translation al-
together. This can make using translations in a dynamic set-
ting quite problematic. Finally, even if we manage to create a
non–intrusive, well–behaved translation, it might be the case
it is such only for a subclass of the possible source frame-
works. Similarly, an intricate transformation can be signif-
icantly simplified if certain assumptions are made. There-
fore, the efficiency, semantics behavior, structural changes
and domain coverage attributed with a given translation can
be used to compare both the transformations and different
argumentation frameworks.
The result of our work is an in–depth compendium on
the intertranslatability of argumentation frameworks, con-
sisting of approximately eighty translations. Our focus will
be on the Dung’s framework (Dung 1995), frameworks with
joint attacks (Nielsen and Parsons 2007) and recursive at-
tacks (Baroni et al. 2011), extended argumentation frame-
work and its collective generalization (Modgil 2009; Mod-
gil and Bench-Capon 2011), bipolar argumentation frame-
work(Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex 2013), argumentation
framework with necessities (Nouioua 2013), evidential sys-
tem (Polberg and Oren 2014) and abstract dialectical frame-
work (Brewka and Woltran 2010). We not only propose a
number of new approaches, but also complete and, if neces-
sary, correct, the existing ones (Nielsen and Parsons 2007;
Oren, Reed, and Luck 2010; Baroni et al. 2011; Cayrol and
Lagasquie-Schiex 2009; Nouioua 2013; Brewka et al. 2013;
Modgil and Bench-Capon 2011; Oren, Reed, and Luck
2010; Polberg and Oren 2014; Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex
2013). As a result of our study, the abstract dialectical frame-
works emerge as perhaps the most general structures, capa-
ble of handling even the extended argumentation framework,
for which the existing results were more limited (Modgil and
Bench-Capon 2011).
In order to be able to compare our approaches and speak
of their quality, we also introduce a classification system for
describing a given translation in terms of functional, syn-
tactical, semantical and computational properties. These at-
tributes are meant to grasp different aspects of a transfor-
mation that we have discussed previously. Furthermore, we
identify certain common patterns behind various translations
and thus also propose to categorize them with respect to
the underlying methodology. Finally, when possible, we use
the existing research on semantics signatures (Dunne et al.
2015; Dyrkolbotn 2014) in order to show whether the pro-
posed translations can or cannot be replaced by methods
with more desirable semantical aspects.
