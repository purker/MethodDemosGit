Abstract. Genetic dispositions play a major role in individual disease risk and
treatment response. Genomic medicine, in which medical decisions are refined by
genetic information of particular patients, is becoming increasingly important.
Here we describe our work and future visions around the creation of a distributed
infrastructure for pharmacogenetic data and medical decision support, based on
industry standards such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the Arden
Syntax.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945285714286">
There is growing consensus in the medical and pharmaceutical community that further
progress in the development of new therapies will necessitate a fundamental change in
medical practice: away from broadly defined disease concepts and therapeutic regimes,
and towards a fine-tuned evidence-based, personalized medicine. Genomic medicine is
an important component of personalized medicine, and refers to a system in which
medical decisions are refined by combining medical history with current physiological
indicators against a genetic background for a particular patient [1]. Since genetics plays

a major role in determining the response to a broad range of therapeutic treatments, the
appropriate use of this pharmacogenetic information for guiding treatment decisions
has the potential to improve the efficacy of treatments and reduce the incidence of
adverse drug events.
While nearly one fourth of all outpatients in the US received one or more drugs for
which pharmacogenetic knowledge is available [2], it is still not common that
pharmacogenetic findings are used in medical practice. Doctors are usually not
specifically trained in genomic medicine, the cost-benefit trade-off of genetic testing is
often unclear, and there is not enough time to incorporate potentially complex
pharmacogenetic reasoning in routine medical decision making.
Therefore, the development of decision support systems capable of handling
pharmacogenetic data is clearly essential to the realization of personalized medicine.
These systems need to provide accurate and timely reminders and decision support
tailored to each individual patient, drug and therapeutic regime. However, creators of
decision support systems for genomic medicine face the challenge of working with
highly heterogeneous information concerning the relationship between genetics and
drug responses based on limited trials. They need to deal with distributed, incomplete
and possibly contradictory information.
Here, we describe our ongoing work and future visions of employing information
technologies to address this problem and towards 1) seamless integration of relevant
pharmacogenetic data in a distributed setting, 2) the exploitation of clinically relevant
pharmacogenetic knowledge in clinical decision support and 3) the design and
dissemination of clinical decision support systems that improve the quality of health
care delivery.

1. Methods
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.882595">
1.1. Data sources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990554021276596">
Several relevant data sources have already become available in an open, interlinked
format, or will be made available soon. We, together with other participants of the
Health Care and Life Science Interest Group [3] of the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C, [4]), worked on making several relevant datasets accessible in RDF/OWL [5]
format. The extraction and conversion of additional relevant datasets such as the
Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB [6]), Drugbank [7], Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM [8]), dbSNP [9] or SNPedia [10] is currently
ongoing.
In addition to manually curated data, natural language processing has been
successfully used to identify pharmacogenomic information, such as gene-drug-disease
relationships [11] or descriptions of new molecular diagnostics [12].
Organisations dedicated to reviewing current evidence and publishing
recommendations about pharmacogenetics have emerged. For example, the Clinical
Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) was recently initiated in the
context of the PharmGKB. The CPIC members create, curate, review, and update
written summaries and recommendations for implementing specific pharmacogenetic
practices. Levels of evidence and strength of recommendations are documented.
Another example of such an organisation is the Evaluation of Genomic Applications in
Practice and Prevention initiative (EGAPP [13]). The text-based recommendations
provided by such initiatives can be easily formalized as rules for clinical decision
support.
1.2. Enabling data integration and semantic interoperability
Ontologies help improve interoperability and data consistency. Several ontologies
relevant to pharmacogenetics have become available in recent years. The Translational
Medicine Ontology (TMO, [14]) provides a foundation upon which chemical, genomic
and proteomic data can be harmonized and linked to disease, treatments and electronic
health records. The Suggested Ontology for Pharmacogenomics (SO-PHARM, [15])
was the first to demonstrate how pharmacogenomic knowledge can be captured based
on the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) resources. The Sequence Ontology aims to
describe the features and attributes of biological sequences [16]. It holds terms and
relations of value for describing genetic variation including single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) at the sequence level.
Our work is guided by international standardisation efforts, and we also participate
in standardisation activities. The most important standardisation organizations in this
context are Health Level 7 (HL7 [17]); and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
which develops standards for large-scale, distributed data integration and access.
A number of developments in the pharmaceutical domain should help to drive the
practice of applying standards for interoperable information systems. The European
FP7 Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) grants, with matching sponsorship from
pharmaceutical companies, have created several projects which need interoperable
information systems in order to share results and information across several IMI
projects that cover domains including drug discovery, electronic patient records,
clinical trials, quantitative modeling, and tissue banking. Participants of the IMI
projects include many academic and pharmaceutical partners, as well as participants in
the EU Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure (BBMRI),
which aims to improve access to biological resources required for health-related
research and development.

1.3. Creating decision support systems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999641888888889">
Rule-based systems are useful for creating pharmacogenetic decision support systems
[18]. We are exploring the use of standards-based rule frameworks such as the Arden
Syntax [19] for this task. Arden Syntax is an HL7 standard that specifies various
aspects of medical logic representation, including mechanisms for triggering rules
based on certain conditions, retrieval of data from medical information systems and
generating conclusions from input data.
Since current findings about the relationships between genetic variability, diseases
and treatment responses are often vague and contradictory, the use of classical rule
engines can be augmented by fuzzy and probabilistic reasoning and consistency
checking. This is being addressed by recently created systems such as Fuzzy Arden
Syntax [20] or the probabilistic OWL reasoner Pronto [21].
To ensure that these developments have a real impact on clinical practice, they will
be complemented by extensive collaboration with clinical practitioners and
international stakeholders. Key factors for successful deployment of decision support
systems have been described in the literature [22]. Based on these findings, the systems
we envision need to be directly connected to hospital information systems, seamlessly
integrated into existing workflows and able to handle information from electronic
patient records and clinical laboratories.

2. Preliminary results and discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9593225">
The Medical University of Vienna together with the Vienna General Hospital are
currently finalizing the establishment of an informatics platform for integrating clinical
data with genomic data, as well as providing clinical decision support based on the
Arden Syntax (Fig. 1).
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.9640598">

Medical University of Vienna is working in close collaboration with the Vienna General Hospital to
implement a new hospital information system that is used for patient care, clinical research and
documentation. The clinical decision support system is part of the new hospital information system. Clinical
and genomic data of patients can be transferred to the service-enabled clinical decision support server.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.988513818181818">
Another relevant development is the European integrated project p-medicine, which
started recently. It focuses on the transformation from reactive to preventive medicine
and a novel systems approach on integrated diagnosis, treatment and prevention in
individuals. Within the project, an open, standards-compliant and modular framework
of tools and services is being developed to enable efficient, secure sharing and handling
of personalized data and in-silico models. Some important aspects are privacy, non-
discrimination, and access policies to maximize patient protection and benefit. The
tools are being validated within concrete, advanced clinical research settings: Pilot
cancer trials have been selected on clear research objectives to emphasize the need for
multilevel data integration. One specific task in p-medicine to provide capabilities to
communicate directly with existing clinical trial and hospital information systems via
push and synchronization services. These services are being implemented based on
existing standards, such as HL7, SNOMED CT, International Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), specifications of the
Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) and Logical Observation
Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) to overcome the inherent heterogeneity of those
systems.
We expect the research programme outlined in this paper to have several
implications for clinical practice, such as improving the translation of basic
pharmacogenomic findings into clinical practice, increasing the deployment of
automated clinical reminders based on patient characteristics and, ultimately,
improving the quality of treatments.
