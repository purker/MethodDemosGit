Abstract: During the last decades, digital objects have become the primary medium
to create, shape, and exchange information. However, in contrast to analog objects such
as books that directly represent their content, digital objects are not usable without
a corresponding technical environment. The fast changes in these environments and
in formats and technologies mean that digital documents have a short lifespan before
they become obsolete. Digital preservation, i.e. actions to ensure longevity of digital
information, thus has become a pressing challenge. The dominant strategies prevailing
today are migration and emulation; for each strategy, different tools are available.
When converting an object to a different representation, a validation of the content
is needed to verify that the transformed objects are still authentically representing
the same intellectual content. This validation so far is largely done manually, which is
infeasible for large collections.
Preservation planning supports decision makers in reaching accountable decisions by
evaluating potential strategies against well-defined requirements. Especially the evalu-
ation of different migration tools for digital preservation has to rely on validating the
converted objects and thus on an analysis of the logical structure and the content of
documents. Existing approaches for characterising and describing objects do not at-
tempt to fully extract the informational content of digital objects and thus are not
suffficient for an in-depth validation of transformed content.
This paper describes the eXtensible Characterisation Languages (XCL) that support
the automatic validation of document conversions and the evaluation of migration qual-
ity by hierarchically decomposing a document and representing documents from dif-
ferent sources in an abstract XML language. The description language XCDL provides
an abstract representation of digital content in XML, while the extraction language
XCEL allows an extraction engine to create such an abstract description by mapping
file format structures to XCDL concepts.
We present the context of the development of these languages and tools and describe
the overall concept and features of the languages. We further give examples and show
how the languages can be applied to the evaluation of digital preservation solutions in
the context of preservation planning.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878775">
The last decades have made digital objects the primary medium to create, shape,
and exchange information. An increasing part of our cultural and scientific her-
itage is being created and maintained in digital form; digital content is at the
heart of today’s economy, and its ubiquity is increasingly shaping private lives.
The ever-growing complexity and heterogeneity of digital file formats to-
gether with rapid changes in underlying technologies have posed extreme chal-
lenges to the longevity of information. So far, digital objects are inherently
ephemeral. Memory institutions such as national libraries and archives were
amongst the first to approach the problem of ensuring long-term access to dig-
ital objects when the original software or hardware to interpret them correctly
becomes unavailable [UNESCO, 2003].
Digital preservation denotes the efforts to preserve digital objects for a given
purpose over long periods of time. The urgency of digital preservation has re-
cently been reemphasised by the results of a survey among archiving professionals
[The 100 Year Archive Task Force, 2007]. In the last years, numerous research
initiatives have started around the world that aim at mastering this challenge.
The two strategies generally considered to prevail today are migration[Testbed,
2001; Mellor et al., 2002] and emulation[Rothenberg, 1999; van der Hoeven and
van Wijngaarden, 2005]. Migration, the conversion of a digital object to another
representation, is the most widely applied solution for standard object types
such as electronic documents or images. The critical problem generally is how
to ensure consistency and authenticity and preserve all the essential features
and the conceptual characteristics of the original object whilst transforming its
logical representation. Lawrence et. al. presented different kinds of risks for a mi-
gration project [Lawrence et al., 2000]. While migration operates on the objects
and transforms them to more stable or more widely adopted representations, em-
ulation operates on the environment of an object, trying to simulate the original
environment that the object needs.
Consider a large collection of documents written in an old version of Word
several years ago. This application does not run on modern operating systems.
One could try to emulate the original operating system; but the emulation soft-
ware still depends on current hardware, and emulating the hardware might be
even harder. On the other hand, one could also migrate the documents to a
current version of Word, or to PDF. While this would lose the original look-and-
feel of the application, it would probably preserve the content and layout. With
PDF, one would exchange the tool support provided by text processing software,
as well as metadata such as an edit history, for a file format that is generally
considered to be quite stable.
An important part of ongoing efforts in many large international projects is
the outreach to vendors for advocating document engineering technologies for

sustainable documents. The effects can be seen in standards such as PDF/A
[ISO19005, 2004] or the Open Document Format (ODF) [ISO, 2006], or MPEG-
7[ISO, 2002]. However, many objects exist and many more are created every day
that face the threats of obsolescence. Hence, ex-post actions for preserving access
to content are necessary. Performing actions on objects always risks damaging
the content; but preserving authentic records also means being able to prove
authenticity[ISSN 1082-9873, 2000; Rothenberg and Bikson, 1999].
Various migration tools are available for standard file formats such as office
documents; the picture is less positive for more exotic and complex compound
objects. However, even within migration tools for office documents, variation
regarding the quality of conversion is very high. Some tools fail to preserve
the proper layout of tables contained in a document; others miss footnotes or
hyperlinks. Finding out which information has been lost during a conversion,
and if this loss threatens the value of the object for a given purpose, is a very
time-consuming task. Some losses might be acceptable, while others threaten
the authenticity of documents. For example, if migrating the collection of Word
documents mentioned above results in a loss of page breaks, this might be irrel-
evant if the textual content is the only thing of interest. However, if there are
page references in the text, this loss might be unacceptable.
The complex situations and requirements that need to be considered when
deciding which solution is best suited for a given collection of objects mean that
this decision is a complex task. Preservation planning aids in the decision making
process by evaluating available solutions against clearly defined and measurable
criteria. This evaluation needs verification and comparison of documents and ob-
jects before and after migration to be able to judge migration quality in terms of
defined requirements. It thus has to rely on an analysis of the logical structure
of documents that is able to decompose documents and describe their content
in an abstract form, independent of the file format. Especially considering mi-
gration actions working on large numbers of objects, it is essential to validate
the authenticity of transformed objects automatically. When migrating a million
documents from ODF to PDF/A, validation of these objects can not be done
manually.
This paper provides an extended presentation of the experiments described
in [Becker et al., 2008b]. It presents the eXtensible Characterisation Languages
(XCL) that support the automatic validation of document conversions and the
evaluation of conversion quality by hierarchically decomposing documents from
different sources and representing them in an abstract XML language. We out-
line the basic concepts underlying the languages. We then describe the main
architecture and features of XCL and discuss its application in the context of
digital preservation.

Digital preservation is a pressing matter – large parts of our cultural, scientific,
and artistic heritage are exposed to the risks of obsolescence[UNESCO, 2003].
The rising awareness of the urgency to deal with the obsolescence that digital
material is facing has led to a number of research initiatives over the last decade.
A large part of the discourse has focused on discussing the dominant strategies,
migration and emulation. Lawrence et. al.[Lawrence et al., 2000] analyzed risks
of migration actions. While emulation is in principle widely applicable, the com-
plexities and costs associated with it form a major obstacle to its wider adoption.
Bearman strongly argues against the usage of emulation in [Bearman, 1999].
Rothenberg as one of the main proponents of emulation in digital preservation
calls for encapsulation techniques to support emulation[Rothenberg, 1999]. En-
capsulation as a complementary strategy packages the object to be preserved
together with instructions on how it can be interpreted. Often the encapsulation
layer is expressed in XML, which has a stronghold in digital preservation[Digital
Preservation Testbed Project, 2002]. It is used not only for encapsulation, but
also as a target file format for migration[Ramalho et al., 2007; Brandl and Keller-
Marxer, 2007] or as a metadata container such as in PREMIS. [see 1]
In the discussion of file formats for long-term preservation it has recently
been increasingly understood that the simple decision to use ‘PDF’ or ‘TIFF’ is
highly problematic, as in both cases it is possible to create either files with very
high as well as very low preservation value. In the case of extremely rich formats
like PDF, this has led to the definition of subsets of the rules comprising the
format which are considered safe for preservation, and furthermore to a tendency
to identify informal ‘subformats’ of file formats[The Library of Congress, 2007;
ISO19005, 2004].
At the heart of a preservation endeavour lies preservation planning. It is a
core entity in the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System, the
OAIS model, which is a widely used model for archives[Consultative Committee
for Space Data Systems, 2002]. It is also a core part of the EU project ‘Preserva-
tion and Long-Term Access via Networked Services’ (PLANETS) [see 2] which
is creating a distributed service oriented architecture for digital preservation.

Strodl et. al.[Strodl et al., 2007] present the PLANETS preservation planning
methodology that aids in reaching well-founded decisions. Becker et. al. describe
the planning tool Plato actively supporting and automating the workflow.[Becker
et al., 2008a]
The procedure defines measurable requirements for preservation strategies
in a hierarchical form and evaluates them in a standardised testbed setting.
Similarly, Ferreira [Ferreira et al., 2007] presents a Service Oriented Architec-
ture for recommending and performing format migrations based on pre-specified
requirements. However, so far most of the evaluation of tools against these re-
quirements has to be done manually. For example, to evaluate if the layout of
a document has been preserved during migration, a human has to look at the
files and compare them with each other. This is not feasible for large collections;
automated services have to be integrated that characterise content to support
this evaluation.
A number of tools and services have been developed that perform content
characterisation specifically for digital preservation. The National Library of
New Zealand Metadata Extraction Tool [see 3] extracts preservation metadata
for various input file formats. Harvard University Library’s tool JHove [see 4]
enables the identification and characterisation of digital objects. However, both
tools only extract metadata such as the presence of specific file format features
in a document; they do not describe the content of a document.
Some solutions exist for transforming, matching, and comparing structured
documents. D´ıaz describes the usage of XML for handling the conversion prob-
lems that arise in the exchange of business documents between organisations[D´ıaz
et al., 2002]. Canfield presents an algorithm for approximate XML document
matching in [Canfield and Xing, 2005]. In the area of grid computing, the Global
Grid Forum Data Format Description Language Working Group has been work-
ing on a language called DFDL[Beckerle and Westhead, 2004] which extends
XML Schema. The aim is to describe the structure of binary and character en-
coded (ASCII/Unicode) files and data streams so that their format, structure, and
metadata can be exposed [see 5]. Thus the DFDL creates a mapping between for-
matted files and corresponding XML representations. The PADS language, on
the other hand, is a domain-specific language based on C-structures that aims
at performance-oriented processing of large, simple structured files[K.Fisher and
Gruber, 2005].

3.1 Introduction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974461538461">
The eXtensible characterisation languages consist of two languages: the descrip-
tion language XCDL and the exctraction language XCEL. The specifications for
both languages are publicly available [see 6].
The Extensible Characterisation Description language (XCDL) allows the
representation of characteristics extracted from files. The definition of charac-
teristics, however, is taken in the broadest possible way: So, conceptually, an
XCDL representation of the information contained within a file can be a com-
plete interpretation of all the information contained in that file.
Converting any number of documents from one format into another, i.e. trans-
forming the actual representation of its content, inevitably raises the issue of pre-
serving authenticity. Moreover, to confidently choose between alternative target
formats and tools, one has to evaluate their suitability in a given context. This
leads to the following underlying questions.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.964840166666666">
1. Which information contained in the old format is also contained in the new
format?
2. Which information relevant to the usage of the content of the old format is
contained in the new format?
3. Is the conversion process a(old,new) better then b(old,new), i.e. does it pre-
serve more of the relevant information contained within the object?
Comparing information in two different file formats implies the following requi-
sites.
1. An abstract way of expressing the information in a format-neutral model.
This is henceforth called an extensible characterisation definition language
(XCDL).
2. A way of extracting information in specific file formats and describing it using
XCDL. While it would be theoretically possible to create an extraction tool
for every given file format, in practice this is not feasible. A better solution
is to define a comprehensive extensible characterisation extraction language
(XCEL) and implement an extractor component that is able to interpret
this language.
3. Algorithms for comparing two XCDL descriptions for degrees of equality.

Such a language should be defined so generic that it supports the description
of arbitrary file formats and thus the extraction of characteristics from any given
file.
An XCDL document describes the content of a specific file with format type
X, tagged in XML according to the XCDL language specifications, and is pro-
cessible through an XCDL interpreter. An XCEL document describes what in-
formation can be extracted from any given file of format X, enabling an XCEL
processor to extract this information and express it in XCDL. XCEL thus creates
a mapping between the declarative description of the information in a physical
file and its abstract interpretation outside of a format specification. Both XCDL
and XCEL are meta-languages defined using XML Schema. In contrast to other
applications of XML in digital preservation, XCL does not migrate digital objects
as a whole to XML nor store exclusively preservation metadata; it transforms
the entire content of an object into an abstract unified form. A key application
we focus on is the comparison of different representations of the same object in
order to validate migration within the preservation planning procedure.
The next sections will describe the basic architecture of both characterisa-
tion languages. We will then outline an example of how they can be applied in
practice.

3.2 The extraction language XCEL
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999881142857143">
The eXtensible Characterisation Extraction Language (XCEL) is a file format
description language for describing file structures to allow their parsing by gener-
alized software. The main goal of the XCEL is therefore to provide all tools nec-
essary for describing real-life file formats like PNG, TIFF, PDF or DOCX. [see 7]
The XCEL is a declarative, descriptive, XML-based language that provides well
defined mechanisms for extending certain parts of the language. As an Extraction
Language the XCEL has some similarities to other domain specific languages for
describing file formats.[Fisher et al., 2006] The Data Format Description Lan-
guage (DFDL) has a number of common properties with the XCEL, there are
significant differences, however. DFDL focuses on scientific data3, XCEL is pri-
marily targeted at file formats as typically held in libraries and archives. The
DFDL is implemented as an extension of XML-Schema, the XCEL is a com-
pletely new language the syntax of which can be described with the XML-Schema
language. Other approaches like PADS are focusing the processing of simple but

of XCEL, however, is, that it does not extract purely technical entities such as ‘a
3 x 256 array of one byte numbers’, but characteristics with a semantic meaning
- ‘a colour lookup table’.
An XCEL document comprises the following components.

1. Preprocessing information includes configuration tasks affecting the be-

Figure 1 shows the abstract relations of XCEL expressions. This structure
– which seems to be simpler than the one proposed by the DFDL [see 8] – is
based upon the assumption that any file format can be expressed as (a) a set of
hierarchies of blocks of content, all of which can (b) be addressed from within
but also outside of these hierarchies.
An XCEL format description starts with an Item, a container element that
can have different content models, similar to the XML-Schema content models.
A Symbol is an expression that adds a name or ID to a specific part of the byte
stream. The Processing element models an expression that is used to call built-
in methods for the extraction processor. This structure describes file formats in
a tree where each branch describes one possible variation. It is the job of the
XCEL processor to find out which branch matches to a given file.

The XCEL processing software (‘Extractor’) processes the binary files of
given formats using the specific XCEL documents created for these formats.
Currently we have prepared XCEL documents for various file formats, focusing
on the image, text and audio data domain (e.g. TIFF, PNG, GIF, WAV, and
PDF). The Extractor is conceived in such a way as to be able to process any
additionally created XCEL document without modifications of its core imple-
mentation. Thus, to enlarge the spectrum of supported file formats one only has
to write an XCEL document for that format.

3.3 The description language XCDL
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976222222222">
The result of extracting content from a file using an XCEL document as input
for an extractor is a description of the informational content of this file in the
description language XCDL. A simple example is provided in Figure 3, which
provides a part of an XCDL description of a text document containing the phrase
‘An important word’.
A common characteristic of content models is a separation between primary
information and properties of that information. Within the textual domain this
separation consists e.g. in the difference between the string ‘An important word’
and the means by which we indicate that the single words in that string are

expressed in specific fonts. The corresponding XCDL representation is provided
below. The normData tag wraps the primary information in a context-free man-
ner, removing or transforming all format-specific information as well as its spe-
cific representation. We call this kind of representation normalised data. Text
encoding is translated into UTF8 by default. The fonts are described within
the property tags. In this case we have a property describing the fonts used.
For each different font a value set is created. The font name appears as a la-
belled value referring to exactly defined terms in the XCL properties ontology.
The dataRef tags define positions within the normalised data by referencing a
propertySet which indicates where the specific fonts are applied. The propertySet
furthermore contains references to all related valueSet entries, thus creating a
bi-directional mapping. This basic structure of separating data and associated
properties is common for all underlying content models: In the case of images,
e.g., the primary stream of bytes describing the pixels can have properties, which
are applicable to an image as a whole (e.g. a gamma correction) or only to parts
thereof, as e.g., an embedded explanatory text in the image.
For preservation purposes, the properties extracted from a file may include
a category of properties which are not needed to model the content of the file.
Consider, e.g., a file format which compresses a part of the data it contains. A
proper XCL extractor, which extracts the content of the file and expresses it
in XCDL, has to be able to apply that algorithm in order to decompress the
content. Once this is done, the algorithm applied to the original file becomes
irrelevant, as the content is simply the result of its application. For preservation
purposes - basically tracking the history of a file and its authenticity - properties
like ‘originally compressed by algorithm X’ can be expressed.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991817318181818">
The XCL languages have been designed with the primary goal of automating
the validation of content in converted representations within the preservation
planning procedure. Figure 4 shows a corresponding scenario for applying XCL
in the context of format migration. After converting a document from ODF to
PDF/A, the XCDL documents of the original and the transformed object can be
compared using an interpretation software. A comparison tool (‘Comparator’)
for XCDL documents is currently under development. Key objectives are the
property-specific definition of metrics and their implementations as algorithms
in order to identify degrees of equality between two XCDL documents. In its core
functionality the comparator loads two XCDL documents, extracts the property
sequences and compares them according to comparison metrics which are defined
with respect to the types of the values in the value sets. In the example of
Figure 3, the comparator looks up the defined metrics for property ‘Fontname’
and executes the comparison according to the metrics definition. This can be a
simple binary comparison that checks the XCL ontology for the entries ‘Times-
Roman’ and ‘Times-Bold’. For other properties such as as possible deviation of
font size, absolute or relative difference measures can be used.
This will provide a sophisticated means for widespread usage, e.g. to evaluate
the quality of a migration process and thus support decisions in the preservation
planning process.
To verify the approach we migrated a benchmark corpus of PNG files [see
9] to TIFF and compared the resulting XCDL documents. In contrast to other

tools such as JHove or tiffInfo [see 10], XCL was able to extract file properties
as well as the normalised content from all files. Comparing the normData with
a tool revealed that conversion of images with specific characteristics was not
working properly.
For evaluating preservation strategies, preservation planning activities define
requirements that a solution has to meet. Often, a complete and extensive com-
parison is not needed. The comparator offers the possibility to select and weigh
only a subset of properties, thus enabling users to regulate the relevance of dif-
ferent properties with respect to their specific needs. By mapping the content
structures in XCDL as well as the results from the Comparator to the require-
ments, performance comparisons across different preservation strategies can be
defined and recommendations for a solution can be given in an automated way.

3.5 Summary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996142857143">
The XCL languages presented in this paper provide a comprehensive and ab-
stract model to describe and express properties of digital objects. The definition
of an XCEL allows to describe these properties with a unique vocabulary. The
implementation of an XCEL processor enables to extract object properties in an
improved quality as XCDL documents. Digital objects described in XCDL can
easily and effectively be processed by interpretation software. We develop such
an interpretation tool to enhance and support digital preservation efforts.

4 Summary and Outlook
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999879">
A range of tools exist today for migration between different document formats.
These tools have very specific strengths and weaknesses. Some fail to preserve
document layout properly, while others would lose content embedded in objects
or fail to preserve structural relations. The evaluation of authenticity of trans-
formed content is a complex task; so is the overall evaluation of suitability of
these tools in a particular situation. Digital preservation is thus in need for
automated characterisation services that support preservation planning in eval-
uating potential strategies. These services need an abstract means of describing
a document’s content in an interoperable, format-independent way.
When comparing the content of two files stored in two different formats,
we have to distinguish between the abstract content and the way in which it
is wrapped technically. On a very abstract level, this will for a long time be
impossible: Whether an image of a hand-written note contains the same ‘infor-
mation’ as a transcription of that note in UTF-8 is philosophically interesting,

but scarcely decidable on an engineering level. In a more restricted way, a solu-
tion is possible if we express the content stored in different file formats in terms
of an abstract model of that type of content.
The extensible characterisation extraction and definition languages presented
in this paper are an important step towards this goal. The extraction language
XCEL allows the extractor component to extract the content of any document
provided in a format for which an XCEL specification exists. The content is
described in the description language XCDL and can thus be compared to other
documents in a straightforward way. This differentiates the XCL approach from
the approach used by JHove and similar projects. The XCL does not attempt to
extract a set of characteristics from a file, but it proposes to express the complete
informational content of a file in a format independent model.
The DFDL language, on the other hand, concentrates on exact typing of
data formats for interoperability on the grid. Consider a binary file with the
content ‘00000000 00100000’. Using DFDL, it is possible to express that the
file contains an unsigned 16 bit number in big endian encoding, i.e. 32. XCL is
able to express that the file contains a 16 bit number in big endian encoding
meaning imageWidth=32. Thus XCL also intends to describe the semantics of a
file.
This paper outlined the basic architecture of the two characterisation lan-
guages, provided examples of how they can be applied in practice and discussed
the potentials of the proposed approach in the context of digital preservation and
preservation planning. Future work will be geared towards implementing auto-
mated verification and evaluation of different tools and integrating comparison
services into the decision support software for preservation planning.

<abstract confidence="0.9978885">the last decades, digital objects have become the primary medium to create, shape, and exchange information. However, in contrast to analog objects such as books that directly represent their content, digital objects are not usable without a corresponding technical environment. The fast changes in these environments and in formats and technologies mean that digital documents have a short lifespan before they become obsolete. Digital preservation, i.e. actions to ensure longevity of digital information, thus has become a pressing challenge. The dominant strategies prevailing today are migration and emulation; for each strategy, different tools are available. When converting an object to a different representation, a validation of the content is needed to verify that the transformed objects are still authentically representing the same intellectual content. This validation so far is largely done manually, which is infeasible for large collections. Preservation planning supports decision makers in reaching accountable decisions by evaluating potential strategies against well-defined requirements. Especially the evaluation of different migration tools for digital preservation has to rely on validating the converted objects and thus on an analysis of the logical structure and the content of documents. Existing approaches for characterising and describing objects do not attempt to fully extract the informational content of digital objects and thus are not suffficient for an in-depth validation of transformed content. This paper describes the eXtensible Characterisation Languages (XCL) that support the automatic validation of document conversions and the evaluation of migration quality by hierarchically decomposing a document and representing documents from different sources in an abstract XML language. The description language XCDL provides an abstract representation of digital content in XML, while the extraction language XCEL allows an extraction engine to create such an abstract description by mapping file format structures to XCDL concepts. We present the context of the development of these languages and tools and describe the overall concept and features of the languages. We further give examples and show how the languages can be applied to the evaluation of digital preservation solutions in the context of preservation planning.</abstract>
