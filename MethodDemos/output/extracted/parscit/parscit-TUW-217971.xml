ABSTRACT

<bodyText confidence="0.973703823529412">
Many real-world Visual Analytics applications involve time-
oriented data. I am working in a research project related to this chal-
lenge where I am responsible for the interactive visualization part.
My goal are interactive visualizations to explore such time-oriented
data according to the user tasks while considering the structure of
time. Time is composed of many granularities that are likely to
have crucial influence on the formation of the data. The challenge
is to integrate the granularities into a detailed compound view on
the data, like the compound eye of insects integrates many images
into one view. Other members of our team are experts in temporal
data mining and user centered design. The goal is to combine our
research topics to an integrated system that helps domain experts to
get more insight from their time-oriented data.

1 RESEARCH PROBLEMS AND STATE OF THE ART
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999883">
Application domains where time-oriented-data occur include com-
merce, health care, public security, and others. These data are usu-
ally multivariate, resulting from heterogeneous data sources. In
many cases, the structure of time has strongly influenced the events
the data results from. The user tasks are complex and involve many
abstract questions. By studying surveys of visualizations for time-
oriented data like the one by Aigner [1], it becomes apparent that
most current work at visualizing time-oriented data is focused on
solving one or more of the pressing tasks, but most visualizations
neglect the structure of time. In the following, this structure is dis-
cussed, as well as what we consider the most important research
topics in developing interactive visualizations.

1.1 The Structure of Time
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988887047619048">
Time is fairly different from other data dimensions. It has an inher-
ent structure which results from social as well as natural contexts.
This structure is interwoven to the non-time-oriented aspects of a
time-oriented dataset, creating a complex multi-level system that is
difficult to visualize. Regarding the structure of time, Information
Visualization (InfoVis) experts have to consider a large number of
aspects. These aspects can be classified according to domain, prim-
itives, determinacy, perspectives, and calendars [5]. As humans are
confronted with the structure of time on a daily basis, it is in our
nature to consider it, but at the same time it is difficult to become
aware of it. However, awareness of one’s action is mandatory for
scientific engagement. One aspect that is especially worth explor-
ing is the calendar aspect. In InfoVis, granularity is often consid-
ered as nothing more than a parameter of discretization. Temporal
data mining has sparked deep research regarding the interaction of
a vast number of temporal granularities [2]. If these are based on
*e-mail: tim.lammarsch@donau-uni.ac.at
a natural context, like the change of seasons, they are usually reg-
ular, but granularities based on social context can also be irregular,
e.g., easter time. They play an important role in many datasets from
real-world applications, like customer data from shops.

1.2 Interactive Visualization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949277777778">
User interaction is one of the most important elements of Info-
Vis, or even the “heart” as Spence states [9]. User interaction is
even more important in Visual Analytics, as studies like the one by
Saraiya et al. [7] shows: users preferred inferior visualizations with
interaction over superior static visualizations. The basic interac-
tions in visualizations of time-oriented data are interval selections,
like zooming and panning, but also others like detail on demand or
brushing. Most interactions are not tailored particularly for time-
oriented data. E.g., if a user analyzes a day and wants to see a day
one month later, she often has to go forward 28–31 days, because
the visualization is at day scale. It would be easier to just go for-
ward one month, without having to think about details. If another
user wants to zoom out to one month, he has not only to respect
different month lengths, but also consider that the day viewed be-
fore might not be in the center of the month. Still, it is most likely
the user wants to see the month that contains the day, from the first
day to the last day. These examples show that it is important for
interactive visualizations to respect the structure of time.

1.3 The Visualization Process
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974111111111">
A widely used visualization process has been described by Card et
al. [3] as Visualization Reference Model. This reference model is
thoughtfully designed to be universally valid for all kinds of inter-
active visualization. To describe more specific visualization tasks,
it is helpful to adapt it and design a more detailed model for the
visualization process. It is important to give a closer description of
the provisions for the structure of time. E.g., the mapping of values
to visual variables should be separable by granularities, giving the
design a larger degree of flexibility.

2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999596222222222">
How can interactive visualization be used to explore time-oriented
data according to the user tasks while considering the structure of
time?
Which existing visualizations can be used if the structure of time is
important?
How can visualizations emphasize the structure of time itself and
not only capitalize on the data?
Which sub-processes are needed in a visual analytics application or
visualizations that consider the structure of time?

3 METHOD OF RESEARCH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996424636363636">
We are focusing on the development of visualizations in the con-
text of the structure of time, in conjunction with time-specific user
interactions. We are also compiling a structured collection of pro-
totypical user tasks. For each visualization, the research process
includes searching for ways to integrate the structure of time as
well as user interaction, but also identification of the tasks that are
supported by it. To do this, we have formed a group of experts in
InfoVis, temporal data mining, and user centered design, from the
university as well as corporate environment. Work shift scheduling
and demand planning are important tasks in areas like commerce,
health care and security. Our planned development steps are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993718111111111">
1. Finding or developing visualizations that make use of the
structure of time and solve pressing real-world problems;
2. Integrating or improving the user interactions as well as data
mining interactions in these visualizations;
3. Empirically analyzing the visualizations according to the user
tasks;
4. Developing a framework based on the Visualization Refer-
ence Model that depicts these steps and implementing it inside
a data management system for time-oriented data.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99887975">
The effectiveness of interactive visualizations can be improved
much by applying user-centered design. Therefore, other mem-
bers of our team are accompanying the whole process by doing user
studies. Their results are integrated seamlessly.

4 WORK PERFORMED SO FAR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999752894736842">
We have explored existing visualizations that already make use
of the structure of time and assessed ways to improve them. Es-
pecially, we have made them more flexible regarding the time-
oriented parameters. Here are two examples.
Cycle Plots have been introduced by Cleveland [4]. They in-
herently make use of the structure of time. Their main purpose is
the detection of trends along a coarser granularity in cases where
there are bigger differences between the granules of a finer granu-
larity. We have successfully used them with different combinations
of granularities.
Multi-Scale Plots have been developed by Shimabukuro et al.
[8] in a work mainly focused on the combination of time-oriented
and space-oriented data as a way to combine overview with de-
tail in one visualization. The visualization makes strong use of the
structure of time, allowing the combination of four granularities and
their data content.
Our implementation is done as a web browser based application.
Therefore, we have also researched platforms for interactive visu-
alizations in that domain [6].

5 NEXT WORKING STEPS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999905">
After assessing several visualizations for univariate time-oriented
data we now want to expand our field of research to multivari-
ate data. A big challenge is that visualizations usually need space
and/or visual variables to show time itself. Showing the structure of
time increases this need. Therefore, less space and visual variables
are available for the data. Furthermore, multiple, but connected,
datasets might be given at different granularities. There might also
be a temporal shift between instances which are connected. A pos-
sible reason is that one is the cause for the other one. An increase
in people counted at the entrance of a shop is likely, but not com-
pulsory, to cause an increase in people counted at the checkout. We
also want to integrate more user interaction. Some ideas:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.854876444444444">
• By selecting a specific granule (e.g., a day) in a multi-scale
plot, the user could switch the view: instead of showing ab-
solute values for the other granules, the differences to the se-
lected one could be shown.
• Almost every interactive visualization can be improved with
zooming and panning features. For time-oriented data, pan-
ning can almost always be considered and implemented as
switching of granules while zooming can be considered and
implemented as switching of granularities.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.7864946">
Another area we want to stress is the integration of data min-
ing and interactive visualization. Some progress we have made in
the area of data mining are currently in need of suitable visualiza-
tions. Other visualization ideas or improvements only work with
data mining behind them:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.781908166666667">
• Our current implementation of multi-scale plots maps aver-
age values directly to color. It is better to use a classification
similar to the one described by van Wijk and van Selow [10].
• Instead of grouping by a granularity in a cycle plot, it is pos-
sible to use a classification algorithm. The classes we have
produced yet can also be regarded as complex granularities.

6 CONCLUSION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981705882353">
Many real-world applications of Visual Analytics involve time-
oriented data. Current methods for temporal data mining and in-
teractive visualizations cannot deal with all user tasks involved in
the analysis of this data. Particulary, they often cannot deal with
complex or abstract tasks that involve several questions at once. We
have explored the state of the art and realized that there is insuffi-
cient support for the structure of time, especially the combination
of several granularities to a compound view on the data. Becoming
aware of the structure of time is a very promising base to improve
interactive visualizations and create new ones. Several visualiza-
tions can be improved by incorporating the structure of time. The
combination of different visualization techniques is also a viable
field of research. We have laid out a way to deal with these issues
and generate scientific progress that will spark research in these ar-
eas. By using a specialized variant of the Visualization Reference
Model, we intend to classify at which parts of the visualization pro-
cess specific parts of our work will be applicable.

Their main purpose is the detection of trends along a coarser granularity in cases where there are bigger differences between the granules of a fin</context>

These aspects can be classified according to domain, primitives, determinacy, perspectives, and calendars [5]. As humans are confronted with the structure of time on a daily basis, it is in our nature to consider it, but at the same time it is difficult to become aware of it. However, awareness of one’s acti</context>

It is better to use a classification similar to the one described by van Wijk and van Selow [10]. • Instead of grouping by a granularity in a cycle plot, it is possible to use a classification algorithm. The classes we have produced yet can also be regarded as complex granularities. 6 CONCLUSION</context>
