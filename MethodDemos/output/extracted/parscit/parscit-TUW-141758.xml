<bodyText confidence="0.97913122">
Medical information is often stored in a narrative way, which makes the automated processing a
difficult and time-consuming task. Persons responsible for the authoring of medical documents do
not take care of a further processing with automated systems. So, information stored in medical
writings is not directly usable for the processing with computers. Due to this, efforts have been
made to transfer these narrative documents in a format easier processable with computers.
This matter of fact also applies to clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). As many medical do-
cuments, CPGs are written in a narrative speech as well, without regards to a computer-assisted
processing. For the implementation of CPGs in medical facilities an automated processing is the-
refore desirable. An important fact is that a lot of information in CPGs is provided in a negated
form, expressing that certain circumstances in patients or treatments are not available, existing
or applicable. Although negated, this information is nevertheless very useful, since it can express
the absence of certain conditions or diseases in patients. Moreover, negations can describe which
treatment options should not be taken into account for a given patient, helping a practising
physician or nurse in his/her decision process for the assortment of a proper treatment. Thus, a
proper Negation Detection in CPGs is an important task for the automated processing of this
type of medical documents. It helps to accelerate the decision making process and can support
medical staff in their care for patients.
We developed algorithms capable of Negation Detection in CPGs. We use syntactical me-
thods provided by the English language to achieve a precise detection of occuring negations.
According to our results we are convinced that the involvement of syntactical methods can
improve Negation Detection, not only in medical writings but also in arbitrary narrative texts.

Kurzfassung
Medizinische Daten werden in der Regel in natürlicher Sprache abgespeichert. Dies liegt daran,
dass medizinisches Personal im Normalfall keine Rücksicht auf eine spätere Verarbeitung in au-
tomatisierten Systemen nimmt. Die Informationen sind daher nicht sofort für eine Verarbeitung
mit Computern verfügbar. Aus diesem Grund wurden vielfach Anstrengungen unternommen,
um die Daten in ein für Computer verarbeitbares Format überzuführen.
Dieser Umstand gilt auch für medizinische Leitlinien (sogenannte “Clinical Practice Guide-
lines” (CPGs)). Sie sind, wie alle medizinischen Dokumente, ebenfalls in natürlicher Sprache
verfaßt, ohne Rücksichtnahme auf eine computergestützte Verarbeitbarkeit. Die Einführung von
medizinischen Leitlinien im klinischen Umfeld macht allerdings eine automatisierte Verarbei-
tung wünschenswert. In diesem Zusammenhang muß weiters beachtet werden, dass ein großer
Teil der Information in medizinischen Leitlinien in negierter Form vorhanden ist. Die Tatsache,
dass diese negiert vorliegt, macht sie aber deswegen nicht irrelevant oder weniger beachtens-
wert. Im Gegenteil, oftmals werden auf diese Art und Weise ungeeignete Behandlungsverfahren
gekennzeichnet, beziehungsweise Behandlungen, die bei gegebenen physiologischen Zuständen
nicht durchgeführt werden sollen oder dürfen. Solche Informationen können den Behandelnden
helfen, die richtigen Therapieverfahren anzuwenden oder auch gewisse Verfahren abzulehnen.
Dementsprechend ist die Erfassung von Negationen (die sogenannte “Negation Detection”) in
medizinischen Leitlinien ein essentieller Bestandteil für die automatisierte Weiterverarbeitung
dieser Art von medizinischen Dokumenten. Entscheidungsprozesse werden somit beschleunigt
und dies wirkt sich positiv auf die Behandlung der Patienten aus.
Um diese Aufgabe zu lösen haben wir Algorithmen entwickelt, die das Auffinden von Nega-
tionen in medizinischen Leitlinien ermöglichen sollen. Dazu benutzen wir syntaktische Verfahren,
die die englische Grammatik gezielt ausnützen, um aufgetretene Negationen exakt aufzuspüren.
Unsere gewonnenen Resultate zeigen, dass die Verwendung syntaktischer Methoden dabei hilft,
die Identifikation von Negationen zu verbessern, wobei unsere Methoden nicht nur auf medizi-
nische Dokumente, sondern auf jede Art von natürlichsprachlichem Text anwendbar sind.

Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999372">
A large part of medical information is only available in natural language, which makes an
algorithmic processing with computers a very difficult task. So to say, this information is “locked
up” in files and databases in a format not suitable for automated processing [Hripcsak et al.,
1995]. A lot of information in medical writings also underlies the concept of negation, which
means, that certain treatment options or parts of a diagnosis, cannot or must not be applied for
a specific patient. Negation Detection has been treated under the circumstances of pathology
reports [Mitchell et al., 2004], discharge summaries or radiology reports [Chapman et al., 2001].
Still, the processing of negated terms in more complicated writings is an open topic. Negation
detection demands a lot of knowledge about language itself to correctly identify negated words
or terms in free text. Endeavour on this topic may help to develop computer assisted treatment
strategies to improve patient care.
The detection of negated terms in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) allows the faster filter-
ing of relevant information. It may be important for a practitioner to decide, which treatment
options are available for a patient and which are not. This information can also be combined
with the occurence of specific physiological conditions. Certain treatments cannot be conducted
under certain physiological circumstances. A fast access to this information can contribute to a
better treatment of patients. A former processing of guidelines including a Negation Detection
supports a practitioner in his/her decision process. Otherwise, the human researcher would need
to read through all possible options by himself, which can be a cumbersome and time-consuming
process.

1.1 Motivation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997505">
Negation is an important part of inter-human communication. It can be used to invert concepts
and to show refusal of opinions. Sometimes persons in life-threatening situations use the simple
word “no” to express their helplessness. In the developement of a person’s psyche and character
a “no” implies that this person has developed his or her own will and is able to express this. A
person who never says “no” will never be asked to give his or her view on a problem, since the
answer is already known. The concept of negation is therefore a universal concept in the most
languages if not in all languages.
The existence of negations in language has been philosophised by man since more than
2000 years. Even Aristotle played with this peculiarities and tried to find a classification of the
different types of negation in natural language and found four classes of negation. He came to the
result that negation can be splitted into four types which he named as correlation (e.g., double
vs. half), contrariety (e.g., good vs. bad), privation (e.g., blind vs. sighted) and contradiction

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 2
(e.g., he sits vs. he does not sit) [Horn, 1989].
The right understanding of a negation demands a competent knowledge of the used language,
since even one word can completely change the sense of the statement. The statement can then
be inverted, weakened or amplified. The following simple example by Horn [Horn, 1989] shows
this effects in negated sentences (as cited in [Mutalik et al., 2001]):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999327666666667">
1. I’m not tired.
2. I’m not a bit tired. (which equals “I’m not at all tired.”)
3. I’m not a little tired. (which equals “I’m quite tired.”)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907421052632">
Even this example shows the complexity of a negation in natural spoken or written language.
In the first sentence the negation is very clear and one cannot be confused in its meaning. The
following two sentences generate subtle problems, because one of them states the complete
absence of tiredness (“I’m not a bit tired.”), whereas the other sentence describes a condition of
exhaustion (“I’m not a little tired.”). A german reader who is not very familiar to the english
language can get problems with phrases when they are written down. The second and third
sentence seem to be equal and the lack of mimic art or a tonal amplification leaves the reader
confused. An english native speaker will in contrast to a non-native speaker have no problems
with the right understanding of the semantic of this sentences.
A search for negations in natural language is therefore a difficult task, but the search for
them in a medical scope can be easier. Medical language is much more restricted than narrative
speech, a physician will not use stilistic elements like double negation extensively to write reports
or patients histories. Thanks to this fact a negation detection in a medical scope is supposed to
be less difficult because of this restrictions.
Negation detection contributes to an information reduction when searching in databases.
Search results can be minimized to the entities searched for, otherwise even negated entities
would be returned in queries. This work contains already existing algorithms for the task of
Negation Detection. It shows, how possible approaches can look like. We also present our
approach of Negation Detection in the area of CPGs.

1.2 Research Question
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999789785714286">
In this work we examine the question, which methods best fit for a Negation Detection in
CPGs. As medical guidelines are not written in colloquial prose the assumption was obvious
that occuring negations would not be of the same complicated type as they are in person-to-
person language. Guidelines may lack the often vast usage of stilistic elements such as the double
negation. This fact may make it easier to come up to algorithms which deliver a proper result.
In order to answer the asked question the research work was divided into following five
sections:
Examining existing studies on Negation Detection. Initially we examined existing works
related to Negation Detection. This part of our work is relevant to decide, whether existing
algorithms or methods can be used for our research.
Selection and analysis of a set of guidelines for developing and testing of our method.
We have chosen a set of 20 CPGs which all deal with the topic “cancer”. We used four of
these guidelines to get an overview over the occuring negations (see Table 1.1). With this
information we developed methods to classify and identify negations.

<bodyText confidence="0.988120727272727">
Development of algorithms for Negation Detection in CPGs. After the hand-reading of
the guidelines we have decided a proper Negation Detection of CPGs. We have analyzed,
if already existing methods are applicable or if we had to develop algorithms tailored to
CPGs.
Implementation. This part of our work contains the implementation of our methods, to see, if
the approch is successful. Furthermore, a refinement was carried out to make the methods
fit to the circumstances of the field of CPGs.
Evaluation. The evaluation presents the results obtained from our implementation of the al-
gorithms. We provide statistical parameters used in the area of Natural Language Pro-
cessing. We used the remaining 16 CPGs (see Table 1.2) selected before for evaluating our
algorithms.

Clinical Practice Guidelines
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999601230769231">
Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are “systematically developed statements to assist practi-
tioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances”
[Field and Lohr, 1990]. They represent the currently best known practice in a given medical
case, they are, so to say, the “state-of-the-art” of a treatment.
The decision options collected in CPGs are gathered according to the best known evidence
about a disease. Therefore, multidisciplinary expert groups together discuss the problem and
all contribute to a CPG. Yet this is not the end of the development of a CPGs. As medical
knowledge also grows and changes in time, CPGs also need to be reviewed from time to time in
order to bring them into an actual state. This fact must be treated with special care, since CPGs
claim to be the “state-of-the-art”, the currently best known knowledge in a certain medical field.
In the following paragraph we give an introduction into the guideline development process
The developement of CPGs [Shekelle et al., 1999] describe the appropriate stepwise devel-
opment process of CPGs as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6673165">
1. Defining the CPG’s topic: The first step in the development process is the selection
of the CPG’s topic. In this step it is important to exactly define which disease is treated.
A refinement is inevitable or else the subject matter would be treated to broadly.
2. Determining the developement group: For a certain topic it is important to gather
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9129135">
experts with the right expertise. Moreover, the employment of multidisciplinary groups is
also of great significancy. Experts from different special fields contribute different opinions
for a comprehensive treatment of a disease. For example, the treatment of cancer does
not only require surgical knowledge but the knowledge of the usage of drug regimens
(e.g., chemotherapy, use of epoetin) as well. Moreover, financial consideration should
also merged with the naked treatment recommendations. Finally, the definition of group
leaders is important for the organisation of the group, so that it effectively reaches the
given aims.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997970166666667">
3. Analysis of the evidence: It is important to ensure that all available evidence is col-
lected, and therefore a systematic review of the evidence is the appropriate way of proceed-
ing. To evaluate the available evidence, the underlying study design needs to be considered,
as well as studies confirming the relevance of the evidence. Finally, a summarization of
the aggregated evidence must be carried out.
4. Compiling evidence and writing the CPG: The evidence needs to be prepared for

the deployment in medical facilities. Clinical circumstances as well as policy or financial
aspects must be considered. The applicability of the developed CPG must be ensured.
5. Maintenance of the CPG in the practical environment: After the introduction of
the CPG in a medical facility it needs to be reviewed at discrete points in time, and in
case of obsolence an update is necessary. This ongoing revision of a CPG is of special
importance, since CPGs, as mentioned earlier, are thought of as the “state-of-the-art” of
a certain medical topic.
As one can see, the development of CPGs is a rather complicated and sophisticated process.
However, this is necessary to ensure that CPGs remain the best known medical practice.
Although the best known practice is aggregated in CPGs, this does not mean that they must
be performed in each and every case. The last decision, which treatment a patient should be
given always depends on the medicating practitioner as well as the patient him-/herself. Only
the practitioner has all information of the physiological state of a patient and only the patient
is in the position to decide, whether he/she appreciates the treatment option or not. So, CPGs
are also an aid for the patients themselves as well as their relatives.
CPGs are developed for certain circumstances, for example particular diseases or conditions
in which potential patients can be. Moreover, CPGs can have several target groups, for instance
physicians, nurses, patients, or students. In this way they aid the way of deciding, which
treatment option properly fits to a patient’s condition and disease. They are helpful for clinicians
who “may also use guidelines to answer specific clinical questions arising out of their day to day
practice” [Feder et al., 1999]. For patients, CPGs represent information material, so that they
can better estimate what is coming up to him/her until his/her (possible) convalescence. If
targeted to students, who do not have the experience of a practicing physician, CPGs serve
as important teaching material. Nevertheless, in most cases the target group of CPGs will be
physicians and nurses.
An important topic in CPGs is the methodology used to analyze the evidence and to assess
the quality and strength of the evidence. This means, what kind of research has been carried
out to constitute the evidence of recommendations in a guideline. In this point, CPGs suffer
from a lack of standardization. Each organization developing CPGs features a different kind of
grading schema. This makes a cross-comparison a confusing task [Atkins et al., 2004b]. Efforts
have been carried out to tackle this problem. For example, the GRADE working group1 aims
a standardization of the grading schemas for the levels of evidence [Atkins et al., 2005, Atkins
et al., 2004a]. Another attempt is to subsequently provide a meta schema based on the different
existing schemas available in CPGs [Kaiser et al., 2007]. In this approach the different schemas
using different symbols for the levels of evidence are mapped to a meta schema, where all grading
schemas are represented by the same symbols, thus making a comparison possible.
The section containing the actual instructions of a CPG is the recommendations section.
Here, the intended user can gather information about treatment options, ways of diagnosis in
certain cases, and what kind of evidence is provided for that specific recommendation. Although
this section contains a lot of instructions, these instruction are not a must in each and every
case. The strict obedience of a recommendation does not always lead to good results in the
treatment of patients. The physician has to decide for him-/herself, if this treatment option is
reasonable for a specific patient with specific physiological characteritics. Recommendations in
CPGs can also be meant in a negative way. This makes sense when a certain treatment must
not or should not be accomplished for a given patient. In this case it is meaningful to provide
a foregoing sorting out or presentation of those recommendations not advisable. A Negation

<bodyText confidence="0.999892085714286">
Detection helps to achieve this kind of information. Thus, treatment decision can be accelerated,
since the physician needs not manually read through all sort of recommendations.
The authors of CPGs also give information about potential unforeseeable side effects caused
by the implementation of a CPG. For example, some treatments for cancer can cause oncologic
diseases by themselves. This fact needs to be regarded, when a CPG is launched in a med-
ical facility. The so-called “Strength of recommendation” gives information on this topic. It
describes, how securely a treatment option can be accomplished for certain circumstances. It
provides aid for the decision if the specific treatment should be carried out or if there are factors
which delimitate the benefits of the treatment. In other words, the strength of recommenda-
tion expresses the trade-off between the benefits and potential harms of a therapy according
to the underlying level of evidence, which can range from a very high level (achieved by meta-
analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs)) to a low level (which indicates, that an evidence
supporting the recommendation is absent). A distinct “Benefits/Harms of implementing the
guideline recommendations” section often also provides supplementary information to this kind
of questioning.
For the implementation of a CPG in a medical facility there is also a section for information
about this topic. This supports the responsible persons in the implemenation process and errors
in the implementation can be avoided. In general, it is easier to launch CPGs in medical facilities
with a manageable target groupt. The larger and the more complex the organization’s structure
is, the more difficult is an implementation of CPGs. With growing complexity of the organization
the barriers of implementation also grow [Feder et al., 1999].
As one can see, the development of a CPG is a very complex process. It can only be done by
the cooperation of experts from several disciplines and by studying already existing knowledge
about diseases and their options of diagnosis and treatment. The creation of a CPG is also a
very sensible process, since false medical instructions can lead to mistakes in the treatment of
patients and may lead to complications or even the death of persons. Although a CPG contains
the best known knowledge on a certain health topic, the practitioner is always responsible for
him-/herself to decide, if a specific recommendation is applicable for a patient or not. As
mentioned earlier, they are intended to assist, not to dictate a physician.
Negation Detection contributes to a faster processing of CPGs and allows the responsible
persons to achieve relevant information more quickly. As mentioned earlier, negative recommen-
dations can be especially emphasised foregoing, or treatment options not advisable for a certain
disease in a patient with a certain condition can be displayed. The proper detection of nega-
tions is therefore a contribution to the improvement of the implementation and dissemination
of CPGs and their deployment in medical facilities

Although the subject of negation has already been discussed by the ancient Greek there have
been little achievements of an automated negation understanding and processing. Specifically in
the field of medicine there are only few studies concerning this topic. The two most important
studies relating to an automated negation detection in medical documents have been carried out
by the University of Pittsburgh and the Yale University School of Medicine. Furthermore, the
University of Sofia in Bulgaria has performed a study for the identification of negations in the
Bulgarian language, which is by now a merely researched field in this language.
In order to fully understand the explanation of used Negation Detection techniques, the
knowledge of some important resources supporting Natural Language Processing in the realm of
medicine will be necessary. The following section gives an insight into used resources relevant for
the comprehension of the performed studies. Section 5 describes statistical measures necessary
for the evaluation of the presented methods. In Sections 3.3 to 3.10 we describe related work

SNOMED®was developed by the College of American Pathologists (CAP). The CAP had by
now worked with the ancestor of SNOMED®, SNOP (Systematized Nomenclature of Pathology).
In the year 1974 SNOP was extended with the help of Dr. Roger Cot´e in order to contain
vocabulary beyond the scope of the pathologic special field and SNOMED®was born.
In 1977 SNOMED®was turned from its printed representation into an electronic tool, created
to facilitate the use for physicians, researchers, and healthcare professionals.
With SNOMED-RT (Reference Terminology) a new generation of SNOMED®was intro-
duced in January 1999. SNOMED-RT was created to better fulfill the needs in the fields of
health states, disease states, pathophysiology, treatments and outcome.
In the same year in March a fusion of SNOMED-RT and the United Kingdom National
Health Service (NHS) Clinical Terms Version 3 (former known as the Read Codes) was per-
formed. SNOMED-CT®(Clinical Terms), the currently most comprehensive vocabulary for
medical terms, evolved from this merging.
In SNOMED-CT®medical information such as diseases is defined by concepts. These con-
cepts are refined by several hierarchies or axes, for example, ”disease”, ”finding site” or ”pro-
cedure”. In order to identify concepts they are provided with a concept ID, which is a simple
numerical value. Existing relations among concepts are stored too.
The information provided for a given concept is composed of a unique numerical code, a
unique name (the so called ”Fully Specified Name”) and further descriptions such as synonyms.
Moreover, information about the concept’s location in the hierarchy and relations between other
concepts are recorded.
Important facts of SNOMED-CT®[SNOMED]:
. Its included Semantic Net contains over 300,000 medical concepts and the relationships
among them
. More than 7 million relationships are available
. The concepts cover several fields such as diagnosis, drug definition, findings, procedures,
anatomy etc.

Health Organization of the League of Nations until 1948.
At that time the WHO was committed the function of revising the ICD, which happened
one year later with the 6th revision.
In 1977 the WHO published the 9th revision of the ICD (ICD-9)consisting of three volumes,
the first two of them containing diagnosis codes, the third covering procedure codes. From
the ICD-9 emerged the ICD-9-CM (Clinical Modifications), which is used for the calculation of
hospital treatment costs in order to facilitate the account with concerned insurance companies.
The currently used versions are the 1999 published 10th revision (ICD-10) and the ICD-9-
CM.
The ICD-10 provides alphanumerical codes for the identification of diseases or abnormal
findings in humans. The ICD contains 22 different fields, each having a unique code. Diseases
or findings within a special field are then identified by this field’s code and an additional numeric
code specific for the finding. For example, the occurence of neoplasms is coded with the letters
C and D, malign neoplasm have the range from C00 to C97 applied. C30 to C39 stands for
malign neoplasms of the respiratory and intrathoracic organs. The value C34 is used for malign
neoplasms of bronchus and lung. To conclude, the diagnosis “lung cancer in the upper lobe”
would be codified by the alphanumeric value C34.1.

3.1.3 Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.797894666666667">
The UMLS is a controlled collection of vocabularies with its internal structure designed to map
between them. The system was initially designed in 1986 by the National Library of Medicine,
USA.
As UMLS is a collection of various vocabularies, it allows conversion of medical terms from
one vocabulary into another. This fact is described in [Humphreys and Schuyler, 1993] as follows:
The UMLS approach assumes continuing diversity in the formats and vocabularies of
different information sources and in the language employed by different elements of
the biomedical community. It is not an attempt to build a single standard biomedical
vocabulary.
The structure of the UMLS contains three main knowledge sources:
1. The Metathesaurus®: It represents the base of the UMLS, containing 5 million con-
cept names identifying more then 1 million biomedical concepts. These names come from
over 100 controlled medical vocabularies such as SNOMED CT or the ICD-9-CM. Metathe-
saurus is intended to enable the work with the different vocabularies and provides facilities
for the information exchange between different medical databases. The scope of it is as
wide as the underlying used source vocabularies. A software program can receive informa-
tion from Metathesaurus, users can pose inquiries and they can obtain help for a conversion
of a vocabulary to the existing uniform vocabularies.
2. The Semantic Network: Semantic networks are generally the representation of a given
knowledge base [McCray, 1989]. The network contains nodes to represent semantic con-
cepts and links for the representation of relations between the concepts. For example,
there are nodes for the representation of organisms, biologic function or chemicals. For
UMLS the network is established to facilitate the use of the system. It categories the
concepts in the UMLS Metathesaurus and offers relations between concepts.

3. The SPECIALIST Lexicon: It lexicon provides the lexical information for the SPE-
CIALIST Natural Language Processing System. It can be used as a general English lexicon
expanded by a medical vocabulary. The tools were developed to deal with the high vari-
ability of words in the natural language. The identification of inflected words (i.e., treat:
treats - treated - treating) can be accomplished with these.

3.2 Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996891">
The accuracy of an implemented algorithm needs to be analysed with approved statistical pa-
rameters, in order to allow a comparison with different, already existing algorithms. The value
of a statistical parameter is also a statement about the efficiency and precision of an algorithm.
High values signify a high quality of the used procedure. Although this seems to be a simple
decision strategy for the usage of an algorithm, one has to be careful with the outcome of statis-
tical analyses. Ignorance or the intentional abuse of these statistical parameters can very easily
lead to a wrong decision for the choice of an algorithm. In a strict medical context adulterations
are used to enable the launching of a new medication which has not been tested carefully enough
before.
For the evaluation mainly four statistical parameters are used, which are listed below.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.578528">
3.2.1 Sensitivity/Recall
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997467">
The sensitivity is a statistical parameter and very often used in medicine. It provides information
about the ability of a test to identify individuals having a special disease (an individual having
a given disease is called “positive”, e.g., “HIV-positive”, meaning that the person carries the
HI-virus). In other words, the sensitivity evaluates the probability of detecting a statistical unit
to be positive, if this unit is really positive. The better the test, the more of the individuals
having a given disease are identified.
The formula for this statistical parameter is relatively simple. As sensitivity reflects the
accuracy of finding positive test results (i.e., the presence of a disease, the presence of a negation),
the number of the found true positive statistical units is divided by all existing positive units in
a basic population (when talking of sensitivity in biological circumstances):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.989232333333333">
Z TruePositives
Sensitivity =
Z TruePositives + Z FalseNegatives
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999304">
In the case of information retrieval systems, the sensitivity is replaced by the so-called recall.
For the calculation of this statistical parameter, partially correct identifications of entities are
used too. Partially correct means, that in a selection process an entity has been correctly
identified, but only a part of it. Therefore, the partially correct results contribute half the value
of a true positive result [Lehnert et al., 1994]. The formula looks as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.883599">
Z TruePositives + 21 ∗ Z PartiallyCorrects
Recall =
Z TruePositives + Z FalseNegatives + Z PartiallyCorrects
3.2.2 Specificity
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999025">
This is the counterpart of the sensitivity, measuring the accuracy of finding true negative entities.
The specificity is the probability of a test resulting negative, if the examined statistical unit is
negative in actual fact. It is calculated by dividing the number of true negative statistical units
by all existing negative units in the basic population:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.988318333333333">
Z TrueNegatives
Specificity =
Z TrueNegatives + Z FalsePositives
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99738">
The existence of an HI-virus is tested with the so called ELISA test (Enzyme-linked Im-
munosorbent Assay). This test comes with both sensitivity and specifity about 99.5 %, other
sources speak of 99.9 %. Such high values for this two statistical parameters indicate, that the
test is of an excellent quality.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.573617">
3.2.3 Positive Predictive Value (PPV)/Precision
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999512">
The positive predictive value provides information about the probability of having a given dis-
ease, when a test result is positive. A medical test should have a high PPV, otherwise a patient
or his examining physician could never be sure, if the searched disease is present in fact.
For the calculation of this value a simple formula can be used. It is the number of true
positive results divided by all positive result (false positives are included):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.993986">
Z TruePositives
PPV =
Z TruePositives + Z FalsePositives
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959666666667">
The positive predictive value for the ELISA test is 91 %. This means, that of 100 persons
with a positive test result, in fact nine of them do not carry the HI-virus, so they are mistakenly
considered to be positive.
In the area of information retrieval the positive predictive value corresponds to the so-called
precision. Here, partially correct results also get only half the value of a true positive [Lehnert
et al., 1994]. The precision can be calculated as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9852735">
Precision =
Z TruePositives + Z FalsePositives + Z PartiallyCorrects
</equation>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.690411">
3.2.4 Negative Predictive Value (NPV)
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.961103666666667">
This value is the counterpart of the positive predictive value. It gives information on the prob-
ability of the lack of a given feature, if a test resul is negative.
The formula is similar to the formula of the PPV:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.989275">
Z TrueNegatives
NPV =
Z TrueNegatives + Z FalseNegatives
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.985063">
The ELISA test has a negative predictive value of 99.999 %.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.622078">
3.2.5 Correlation between Statistical Parameters
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997926">
Sensitivity and specifity are strongly related: the knowledge of only one of these two statistical
parameters is not a very meaningful measurement of the accuracy of a testing procedure. For
example, the sensitivity can easily be pushed to 100 % by regarding each and every test result
as positive. Only when combined with the specificity (which would in this case normally be
surprisingly low) the sensitivity becomes a suitable measurement.
Both PPV and NPV are dependent on the so called prevalence, which is either the total
number of occuring positive objects in a statistical universe or the ratio of the number of occuring
positive objects at a specific time and the total number of objects in that universe at that
time.When the prevalence is high it is easy to gain a good PPV, vice versa it is easy to obtain
a good NPV if the prevalence is low.

1. Only one sentence per line: this leads to an information loss when more then one

their UMLS-representation. Because of the large extent of UMLS the indexed terms were
delimited to the scope of “Finding”, “Disease or Syndrome” and “Mental or Behavioral

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.442493">
3.3.2 Description of the Algorithms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973180409090909">
For the realization of the study two algorithms were used. A simple baseline algorithm was
compared with the more sophisticated NegEx algorithm.
The baseline algorithm was an algorithm used by the so called IPS system to identify patient
subgroups and was created by the University of Pittsburgh. It searches for six negation phrases
and marks all UMLS terms from the negation phrase to the end of the sentence.
NegEx was designed on the basis of this simple algorithm but was extended by 29 negation
phrases to a total amount of 35 detectable negations. The phrases were searched by manually
reading 1050 reports. In comparison with the baseline algorithm NegEx uses a more complex
way of extraction. While the baseline algorithm negates everything from the occurence of the
negation until the end of the sentence, NegEx differs between two basic negation types, where
one group comprises pseudo-negations which only change the meaning of a term (e.g., “gram-
negative”) or which are double negatives (e.g., “not ruled out”). The second group covers the
real negations and these are extracted by NegEx. In this group a differentiation between the
position of the negation phrase in relation to the negated phrase is carried out. In the first type
the negationen phrase is positioned before the UMLS term:
&lt;negation phrase&amp;gt; * &lt;UMLS term&amp;gt;
In the second type the negation phrase is positioned after the UMLS term:
&lt;UMLS term&amp;gt; * &lt;negation phrase&amp;gt;
The asterisk stands in this context for up to five tokens which can be either words or UMLS
terms. With this method negated UMLS terms can be detected even if they do not stand next
to the negation phrase. Moreover, a more distinct extraction than with the baseline algorithm
is possible.

3.3.3 Performance Analysis

<bodyText confidence="0.97633975">
A performance analysis was carried out which came to the result, that both algorithms marked
negation with practicable precision. The baseline algorithm had its strength in sensitivity and
negative predictive value, NegEx performed better in specifity and negative predictive value.
Table 3.1 shows the detailled results of each algorithm:

<bodyText confidence="0.99964175">
These results follow from the different designs of the two algorithms. The baseline algorithm,
extracting everything from a found negation to the end of the sentence were the negation was
found, results in a high sensitivity, but this also leads to an extraction of words which are not
really negated. This fact lowers the positive predictive value.
NegEx with its higher precision results in a very high specificity, however, the disadvantage
of its design is, that words, which are actually negated, are not extracted because of their spatial
distance to the negation phrase. This loss in sensitivity could be removed by a widening of the
scope, within words are extracted, yet would this lead to a loss of specificity.

3.3.4 Applications of NegEx
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975375703703704">
In [Meystre and Haug, 2005] an implementation of NegEx serves for the identification of nega-
tions too. In this work a system was created to allow automated processing of problem lists in
medical reports. As they are important components of medical records they need to be as accu-
rate and up to date as possible. In reality, the hand written problem lists are often incomplete
and therefore there is a need for simple processing routines, so that the problem lists gain in
accuracy.
In order to identify medical concepts a mapping of the free text to the UMLS by MetaMap
[Aronson, 2001], an element of the SPECIALIST lexicon, is carried out. As MetaMap does not
support negation detection a following implementation of a detection algorithm was required and
the authors chose the NegEx algorithm. The authors have not carried out an efficiency analysis
of their implementation of NegEx but relied on the values given in the study by Chapman and
colleagues [Chapman et al., 2001].
Another work [Mitchell et al., 2004] uses the NegEx-algorithm for the detection of nega-
tions in pathology reports. In a first step, a number of pathology was randomly selected. Four
pathologists read through these reports and assigned negated concepts. Discrepancies between
the pathologists were mostly eliminated by a comparison between the negated concepts. The
reports assigned by the pathologists were used as a gold-standard for the evalution of the auto-
mated system.
The system works in three steps: the pathology reports are at first split up into the document
sections “Gross Description”, “Final Diagnosis”, “Microscopic Description”, “Comment” and
“Other”. Afterwards, concepts are annotated using a set of UMLS semantic types. This set
was chosen to fit the needs of pathology reports. In a last step, negated concepts are identified

using the algorithms of NegEx. For the evaluation the author used recall and precision, both in
lenient and strict version.
Although NegEx was originally not designed for a usage in pathology reports it performed
quite well. Table 3.2 shows the results of the evaluation:

The table shows, that NegEx performed worst in the case of the Microscopic description

In [Mutalik et al., 2001] a different approach to negation detection was chosen. Here, a lexical
scanner and a parser were applied, which are methods used to develop tools for the processing
of (formal) computer languages. This procedure resulted in considerable values of sensitivity
and specifity.
To achieve these results, a system of several components was used like a pipeline. Each
component represents a step to the final result, which is the accentuation of negated phrases in

<listItem confidence="0.986595666666667">
1. Concept finding: This step is carried out to find UMLS concepts in the document. If
such a concept is found, some information about it is stored in the output. This information

the UMLS concept.
2. Input transformation: In the second step the information of the first step is combined
with the original document. Each phrase that represents a UMLS concept is replaced by
its UMLS concept ID.
3. Lexing/Parsing: The output of the former steps is passed to a lexical scanner (lexer).

negation signal normally precedes or succeeds its negated phrase, or if it generally negates
more then one concept. After this, the parser receives the classified sentences as single
tokens. It applies its grammar rules to connect the negation signals with the phrases they
negate. When this step is finished, a document is available that contains the information
about found negations.

The algorithm used for the identification of concepts tries to match phrases up to five words.
If this is not possible, it splits the phrases into subsections and performs another matching
attempt.
For the purpose of concept matching the authors use the IBM Intelligent Miner for Text,
which allows linguistic analysis and is able to identify special terms like names or abbreviations1.
The medical vocabulary used comes from the UMLS Metathesaurus, which is stored on a MS

In this processing step recognised medical concepts are replaced by their UMLS-IDs. The output

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.565078">
3.4.4 The Lexical Scanner
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9529104">
The lexer is used for the identification of occuring negation signals. Moreover, it is able to
determine the scope of the affected terms. For the purpose of finding negation signals more than
60 words or patterns are recorded, which enable the lexer to mark up negations.
Thanks to its implementation the lexer is able to answer following questions considering a
negation:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9969897">
1. Is the negation signal a preceding or succeeding one? The word “no” normally negates
terms following it, whereas in the case of “not present” the negated terms stands before
the negation signal.
2. Is only one concept or more than one concept negated? “No”, for example, is able to
negate more than one following term.
3. The lexer is also able to decide in negations of more than one concept, if the negation
signal normally precedes or succeeds the negated phrases. For this purpose, it uses a
difference between the conjunction operators “or” and “and”. “Or” normally indicates
a preceding negation signal (“no murmurs, rubs or gallops”), whereas “and” signifies a
succeeding signal (“murmurs, rubs and gallops are absent”).

<bodyText confidence="0.9999126">
Above this, the lexer is also able to tell the parser about the scope of a negation. For this
purpose it uses a vocabulary of terminating terms. This terms indicate, that the end of the
negated phrases is reached and that a new part of the sentence begins. For example, many
prepositions terminate a negated sequence as a general rule. In the sentence “no complications
during surgery” only the concept of complications is negated. Another example for terminat-
ing terms are relative pronouns, such as “which” or “that”. In the note “There was absence
of temperature sense which supports spinothalamic involvement” the negation of the concept
“temperature sense” just indicates the occurence of “spinothalamic involvement”.
When the lexer has finished its decision finding process, it passes the indexed phrases as
single tokens to the parser.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.899657">
3.4.5 The Parser
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947461538461">
The parser used in this study works on the tokens it receives from the lexical scanner. Infor-
mation about negation terminators or the scope in which a negation signal negates is provided
by the lexical scanner. Because there is no need for an exhaustive analysis of the syntax, the
grammar used by the parser is much simpler than normally used for the processing of natural
language.
The actual job of the parser is to finally decide about the characteristics of a negation. It
decides, where a negation starts or ends, how many words are concerned by the negation signal
and if the negated phrases precedes or succeeds the negation operator. The accomplishment
of this job is strongly dependent on the information it receives from the lexer. If there is no
information about negation terminators, it considers the end of the negation three words after
the negation operator. The number of exactly three words for the scope of a negation was given
by an analysis of the sensitivity and specifity reached with a scope of more, or less, than three
words.

3.4.6 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999898263157895">
The evaluation of the algorithm was splitted into two parts. In one part, the designers of
NegFinder validated marked up documents, in the other part an independent observer was
engaged to do this.
In the first of these two mentioned parts, the NegFinder was applied to a test set of 60
medical documents. The output of this procedure was then validated by the three authors.
For this, they read through the documents, in which the negations were already marked up.
They counted as well negations the NegFinder had missed (false-negatives) as negations the
algorithms had marked by mistake (false-positives). Moreover, information about incorrectly
marked negations was collected.
For the other part of the evaluation an independent human observer read through ten medical
documents and tried to allocate negations exhaustively. After this, the NegFinder was applied
to this set and the results were compared.
To sum it up it can be said, that in the first part already marked documents were controlled
by human observers, in the second part the human observer was controlled by Negfinder. This
lead to following values for the sensitivity and specifity of the algorithm(see Table 3.3):
A slight difference in the specifity of the two evaluation procedures can be noticed. This dif-
ference, statistically not significant, shows, that reading through already marked up documents
creates a bias distorting the true result. On the other hand the difference is so small, that the
two evaluation procedures can be treated equivalent.

<bodyText confidence="0.9997495">
The NegFinder algorithm was applied in the work about the knowledge-based MediClass system,
which supports the processing of both free text and coded data in electronic medical records
(EMR) [Hazlehurst et al., 2005]. MediClass (for “medical classifier”) can operate on any EMR
which can use the Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) for data representation. CDA is a
document structure based on XML to store and transfer clinical documents, which was developed
by the Health Layer Seven health care standards organization (the seven stands for the seventh
layer of the ISO/OSI Basic Reference Model).
In order to recognize the change of the semantic meaning of concepts in EMR modifiers are
searched for which can influence the meaning of a concept regarding it’s severity, classification
and negation. For negation detection, a small set of negation terms is used for the processing
with NegFinder’s lexer and parser, since the authors believe that even a little number of detected
negation signals lead to reasonable results.
Unfortunately, the authors do not provide statistical values for the reached accuracy of their
implementation of NegFinder.

<bodyText confidence="0.933116818181818">
A set of 41 medical reports was used to evaluate the accuracy of an automated negation detection
system. These reports were provided to the Mayo Vocabulary Server as ASCII files containing
data in free text. With the Mayo Health Record Parser these text files were splitted into
subsections typical for the reports, such as “History”, “Physical Examination”, “Diagnostic
Testing”.
This output was then preprocessed to differ between textual fragments and operators like
“And”, “Or”, “Maybe” and so on. Medical concepts in the text were then indexed using
SNOMED CT®. After this procedure, the actual negation assignment takes place. For this
CHAPTER 3. RELATED WORK 20
purpose, a so called “automated negation assignment grammar” is used. This grammar splits
free text phrases into four semantic components:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9989635">
1. Kernel concepts: these contain the semantic basis of the phrase
2. Modifiers: Modifiers change the meaning of kernel concepts in a medical way, e.g.
”“severity” expresses the level or stage of a disease.
3. Qualifiers: Here a qualifier changes the meaning of a term regarding its temporal or
administrative content like “recurrent”.
4. Negation qualifiers: these are signals for the occurence of a negation.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996976">
Moreover, a collection of negation stopping phrases is used. These phrases signal the end of
a negation’s scope. For example, in the phrase “The patient denied a history of previous cardiac
disease other than palpitations which he experienced while giving representation resultingin
syncope”, other then limits the scope of the negation signal “denied” to “a history of previous
cardiac disease”.

This study comes from the university of Sofia and deals with the problem of processing a language
different from English, namely Bulgarian [Boytcheva et al., 2005]. For the English language the
strongest effort in Natural Language Processing and negation detection has been made, whereas
other languages have been treated more like stepchildren. The University of Sofia worked on a
system called MEHR (Maintaining Electronically Health Records) for the indexing of medical
terms and facts like negations in electronic health records, written in Bulgarian.
In the process of indexing medical terms and tagging negations, an electronic health record
(EHR) undergoes five separate steps which are worked off in a serial pipeline. The output of
CHAPTER 3. RELATED WORK 21
this procedure is a patient’s chronicle containing position and scope of found negations and the
medical information of this patient.

typical for bulgarian health records, which are: personal data, anamnesis, status, examina-
tions, consultations, debate, treatment, treatment results, recommendations, working abilities,
diagnosis. After this procedure MEHR begins with the analysis of the received file in five steps:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997316928571428">
1. Annotation and chunking: The A&amp;C module begins with tagging syntactical structures
in the received file. It is programmed in Perl and works like a part-of-speech tagger. This
module contains a lexicon with about 50 000 words and contains medical vocabulary and
terms typical for EHRs.
2. Post processing module: The post processing module uses a lexicon with verbs specific
for medicine. It also works with verb frames and grammar rules to identify verbal chunks.
3. Negation treatment module: In this step the negation detection begins and found
negations are marked. A detailled description of the working method of this module is
given in the following subsection.
4. Extractor: This module uses a database with medicine-specific terms to describe the
patient’s symptoms and diagnosis.
5. Filling scenario templates module: To obtain a correct patient’s chronicle this module
fills in obligatory and opitional fields of a form mask. It ultimately creates the patient’s

3.6.2 Details of Negation Identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999253235294118">
The authors of the study differ between two kinds of negation, which are common in the bulgarian
language: general negations, where a whole statement is negated, and partial negations, in which
only one or more parts of a statement are negated.
A general negation in Bulgarian is often indicated by the word “ne” (not). With this negation
signal an action signalled by a verb is negated, and general negation means, that a verb is
negated. Added negation signals like “ni” (nor) or “nito” (neither) are used to repeat the
negation or to increase its strength. However, the use of these two negation signals turns the
general negation into a partial type. For example, in the sentence “He does not drink.” the
whole concept of drinking is negated, whereas in the sentence “He does not drink neither wine
nor whiskey” the two drinks are negated seperately. Another signal for a negation a verb action,
i.e. a general negation, is in Bulgarian the preposition “bez” (without) followed by the concerned
verb succeeded by the particle “da”. MEHR treats both variants in the same way.
In a partial negation a phrase or even an attribute of a verb, but not the verb itself is
negated. The preposition “bez” is also used in this context, but this time there is no succeeding
“da” provided. A single attribute is negated, e.g. “dixane bez hripove” (breathing without
crepitating). Another case are the so called inherent negatives. These are verbs having a negative
meaning but are presented in a positive form. Examples for them are:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.349875">
CHAPTER 3. RELATED WORK 22
</construct>
<listItem confidence="0.9983384">
• “n~ma” (there is not, not exist) as the negation of “nma” (there is, exist). The positive
verb differs from the negating verb just by the letter “ya”, so they are different words,
whereas the English only uses “not” in this case to negate an existence.
• “lipsvam” (absent) as the negation of “pris•stvam” (be available).
• “otriqam” (deny) as the negation of “priznavam” (confess).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999694">
The authors also direct their attention to sentences with a more complex structure. Com-
bined elements which then are negated by only one negation signal need a special treatment, i.e.
“bez hirzutiz•m amenorea” (without hirsurtism, amenorea). The same applies for sentences,
in which more verbs are negated. In Bulgarian for this purpose a repetition of “ne” (not) is
used, so that the number of “ne” and the number of the negated verbs are the same.

As one can see from the description of the five modules, MEHR is more than only a negation
recognition system. Although one module is only responsible for the treatment of negations in
an EHR, the main goal of the system is more ambitious. The aim is to create a system that
automatically is able to produce completely filled chronicles out of electronic health records.
Negation detection is just the first step towards this ultimate goal.

<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.502581">
3.7.2 Preprocessing
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971888888889">
This step has two main tasks to achieve, which are interesting since they help to simplify the
input records for a later negation assignment. At first, the input is converted into a basic format.
This means, that the file is split into its seperate sentences, all letters are converted to lower
case, and differently written phrases are unified (haemocyte vs. hemocyte). The authors of the
study call this the normalisation. After this, the record is POS tagged by the GENIA tagger.
This part-of-speech tagger is especially designed for the usage in a biomedical scope.
Another important point in this phase of processing is the identification of so called “admin-
istrative entities”. These entities include information about the dosages of medication, duration
of an inhabitation in hospital etc. Quantitative units like “kilogram” are identified as well.

On the one hand there are so called pre-coordinated negated phrases, on the other hand there
are phrases explicitly negated by a negation signal. Pre-coordinated are negated phrases which
are already stored as concepts in SNOMED-CT®, like “no headache”, whereas the other type
is the classic negation, where a negation term or phrase negates a concept. This second type of
negations is treated by an algorithm similar to NegEx, differentiating between phrases that are
preceded or succeeded by their negation flag. The scope of a negation signal is also set to five
words before or after the signal.

AEFI reports contain similar free text components as other clinical narrative reports like
radiology reports, physical examinations or discharge summaries. Considering this fact the
study was carried out to evaluate results of the application of UMLS mapping and negation
detection algorithms in this medical special field.
After the tagging of the AEFI free text records with the UMLS Metathesaurus a rule-based,
finite state machine algorithm was applied for the detection of negated concepts. The algorithms
negation vocabulary list contained only five negation signal, which were no, neither/nor, ruled
out, denies and without.
CHAPTER 3. RELATED WORK 24
Despite the only very little number of used negation signals the algorithm results in rather
high values in recall and precision. Recall and precision are parameter used in the special field
of information retrieval. They are applied to evaluate the results of a searching process. The
recall measures, how many of the relevant documents of a statistical universe could be found
by the searching strategy. The precision describes, how many of the found documents were
relevant documents and is therefore a measurement for the accuracy of a searching strategy.
The detection algorithm used in this study reached a recall of 89 % and a precision of 94 %.

This work presents an early work on the topic of Negation Detecion. The authors mainly
occupied themselves with the topic of “Ad-Hoc Classification”, where “a user needs to sort a
large number of documents into non-standard categories.” [Aronow and Feng, 1997]
For their work they also conducted research to identify negated findings in radiology reports.
They state, that the challenges of an automated processing of medical writings are constituted
of the often poor quality of medical data. Medical data is in most cases not explicitly intended
for a processing with computers.
For their part of Negation Detection they implemented a system called NegExpander. This
system expands the scope of a negation trigger across conjunctive phrases or colons. The sentence
No suspicious masses, suspicious calcifications or secondary signs of malignancy are
seen.
is expanded to
No suspicious masses, no suspicious calcifications or no secondary signs of malignancy
are seen.
Thanks to this expansion, all three phrases affected by the negation trigger “no” can be
identified. For the identification of noun phrases a part-of-speech tagger is used.
Due to the fact, that the work was conducted on the topic of ad-hoc classification, the
authors do not give explicit numbers of their outcome on Negation Detection. In spite of this,
the expansion to determine the scope of a negation trigger is interesting.

In this hybrid approach a regular expression matching is combined with a grammatic parsing
[Huang and Lowe, 2007]. The grammatic parsing is carried out by the Stanford parser [Klein and
Manning, 2003], which is capable of generating a full parse tree of sentences. The information
derived from this parsing tree is used to initially identify possible negated phrases in the sentence,
identifying negation triggers by a regular expression matcher. Afterwards, the actual negated
phrase is determined by using grammar rules typical for the specific negation trigger.
In order to achieve the grammar rules, a set of 30 radiology reports was used. The quality
of the grammar was then tested with another set of 470 reports. With this information, the
negation detection module (NDM) was implemented. The performance of the NDM was again

The authors did not constrain to UMLS concepts as negated phrases. They marked up
biomedical noun phrases, regardless of whether they were UMLS concepts or not.
The evaluation of the hybrid approach was carried out with the help of four physicians and
the test set of 132 reports. The physicians were put into (changing) groups of two and obtained
at a time 30 reports, which were already processed by the NDM. Twelve of these reports were
used to evaluate a bias due to the usage of pre-tagged reports. The left 120 reports were used
to establish the gold-standard, against which the NDM was tested.
As statistical parameters the authors used slightly different version of recall and precision
as presented in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.3, a strict and a lenient version. In the strict version,
partially correct findings are not added to the true positives, whereas in the case of the lenient

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999848777777778">
In the previous sections we presented approaches related to the topic of Negation Detection
in the medical scope. All of them used different algorithms, which performed quite well in
practice. They had in common, that they all used a rather simple type of clinical writing for
which the algorithms were applied. Discharge summaries (see Section 3.3), electronic health
records (Section 3.6), or pathology reports (Section 3.10) are all written in a restricted medical
language. This fact simplifies the problem of a Negation Detection.
In clinical practice guidlines, the used language is more complex. They are written in a
prosaic style, with numerous nested sentences and a more sophisticated, speech-like language.
Due to this, a Negation Detection needs to take care of this problems.
Although CPGs are more complicated than medical reports, they are not as complicated as
real free text, as it is used in novels or poems. They will not use stilistic elements like metaphors,
alliterations, or double negations. Such elements would complicate the identification of negations
even more, since they do not require the adherence to strict linguistic patterns. On the contrary,
they are often used to intentionally complicate sentences to provide additional possibilities of
expression. The management of such would require algorithms, which really can understand the
human language.
In the following section we describe our method of Negation Detection in CPGs, called
NegHunter. It uses grammatical characteristics of the English language to search for negations.

In the following we describe the way of developing our Negation Detection algorithms. We took
a set of four CPGs (cp. Table 1.1) in order to get an overview about different kinds of negations.
This analysis showed that the occuring trigger phrases strongly vary from the triggers used in
related work. Here, triggers are composed of several terms, which represent the trigger as a
whole. For example, in the work of [Chapman et al., 2001] triggers such as “sufficient to rule
the patient out against” are used. Triggers can either affect a phrase which precedes or succeeds
them.
In CPGs the situation is different. Here, a combination of terms to triggers is not useful.
Due to a more complex language style in CPGs, such a way of proceeding would lead to a vast
amount of trigger phrases. A classification of negations leading to a smaller number of triggers
is required. Thus, we came to the decision to use the English syntax for a classification. The
syntax provides possibilities to decide, which phrase in a sentence is affected by a trigger. This
happens by the usage of tenses and prepositions. Thus we need a method to automatically
analyze sentences on a syntactical level. We use the MetaMap Transfer (MMTx) in order to
acquire a part-of-speech tagging of the sentences in a guideline.
Our method NegHunter uses the part-of-speech information to identify negated phrases. In
the following, we give a short overview of MMTx. Afterwards, we present the algorithm we
developed for Negation Detection in CPGs (see Section 4.2).

<bodyText confidence="0.999859166666667">
MMTx was designed to provide Natural Language Processing in combination with a mapping
to UMLS terminology. It is built upon the original MetaMap [Aronson, 2001], which was
implemented in Prolog, and uses the same algorithms as the original. In order to make the
programm available for a larger public MMTx uses to the Java language.
The software takes a natural language text as input and allows a hierarchical splitting into
the following levels of text parts (see also Figure 4.1):

<listItem confidence="0.998925">
1. Section: Each text is cut into several sections, which are either determined by their
textual mark-up (such as abstract, method summary, etc.) or by the text structure, where
paragraphs are used to identify the sections.
2. Sentence: A sentence is, as one would assume, an arrangement of words with a semantical
content.
3. Phrase: This is a meaningfully arranged combination of words within a sentence. Phrases
also include syntactical elements like articles and adverbs.

For the implementation of NegHunter, the classification down to the “phrase”-level was used
(see Figure 4.2). The used negation detection algorithms work with the information provided
by this level of sentence classification.
The MMTx “phrase” is separated into several types of phrases. These types, differing con-
cerning their tense, part-of-speech type (e.g., a noun phrase or adverb phrase) are used to decide
the scope of the trigger, in which negated phrases are expected.
The most relevant “phrase”-classifications available in MMTx are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997211">
• Noun phrase,
• Verb phrase,

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.937800785714286">
All of these phrase types are syntactical elements, of which the English language is built
upon. A brief summary on these elements will allow to have their real meaning in mind:
Noun phrase. A noun is the attempt to subsume the massive diversification of physical ar-
tifacts of the sensually ascertainable environment and of the abstract concepts of the
intellectual world with solitary intellectual entities. They are the semantic objects, with
which the content of speech is modeled. A physical artifact is everything that one is (in the
broadest sense) to touch (like “sunglass” or “ice”. The “sun” is also a physical artifact, al-
though no one would ever be able to touch it). Abstract concepts, however, are everything
CHAPTER 4. NEGHUNTER 30
that is ascertainable with the mind, like ideas, thoughts or theories (“subconsciousness”,
“peace” or “freedom” would be examples for this category). The borders between them
can not be strictly drawn. For example, a “person” can either be physically present (e.g.,
an unknown human in a crowded place) or an abstract representation for the variety of all
persons (e.g., the empty database storage for the clients of a company). The true meaning
can only be determined within the context of the used noun. In a noun phrase, the noun
itself is the so called “head” of the phrase. Although a noun phrase can consist of only
the noun, this is a rather infrequent case. Normally, they occur together with articles and
specifying adjectives.
Verb phrase. The linguistic element of verbs puts all objects into a specific relationship to
their environment. They occur in different tenses, are affected by adverbs and can put a
sentence in the active or passive voice. They express the state of objects (e.g., “the man
is old”), their actions with other objects (e.g., “the player hits the ball) or processes on
themselves (e.g., “the tree grows”).
Adverb phrase. Adverbs are normally used to change or intensify the meaning of verbs, ad-
jectives or other adverbs. MMTx regards the term “not” as an adverb phrase.
Prepositional phrases. Prepositional phrases consist of noun phrases which include a prepo-
sition. Prepositions add auxiliary information like place, time, or direction declarations to
the original noun phrase. Initializing triggers, which indicate such a phrase can be:

Negation Detection in CPGs is a great challenge due to the complicated language structure
of this type of medical document. Contrary to medical reports, such as discharge summaries,
radiology reports etc., they use a sophisticated, speech-like language. This leads to the occurence
of negations that cannot be determined by a certain number of negation triggers. In reports these
triggers, which are several terms combined to one trigger phrase (“sufficient to rule the patient
out against”, [Chapman et al., 2001]), are repeated continuously. A search for such constructed
triggers in CPGs is not as easy. One would have to create a large collection of trigger phrases
with only little possibility of classifying into manageable types. Moreover, every new guideline
would contain new trigger phrases, making a permanent enlargement of the collection of trigger
phrases obligatory. Such a method would be very cumbersome and time-consuming. Thus,
a different approach was used. As language itself provides information on which phrases are
negated in a sentence via the syntax (or the grammar of the language), we decided to use this
information for our Negation Detection. This approach is also similar to the way, the human
CHAPTER 4. NEGHUNTER 31
brain processes negations. Humans are able to decode the semantic content of a phrase and can
decide, if this specific phrase is a negation trigger. If it is, the brain decides using the syntax
which phrase in the sentence is negated.
Our approach is undoubtedly not as efficient as the brain’s methods. Yet it uses methods
of language processing which help us to identify negated phrases in natural language writings,
where a simple subsumption of terms to triggers is not possible due to the complexity of the
underlying text.
Speaking of the usage of the syntax of the language, we mean that grammatical elements like
the tenses influence the direction, in which a trigger term works. It can either affect phrases that
have been mentioned earlier in a sentence (a succeeding trigger respectively a preceding negated
phrase) or phrases that follow after the trigger (a preceding trigger respectively a succeeding
negated phrase). We have come up to five classes in which the negations are split up:
The Adverbial Negation: This type of negation works via a verb, which is affected by a
negation term. The tense helps to decide, where in the sentence the concerning phrase is
allocated.
The Intra-Phrase Triggered Negation: Here, the negation trigger is integrated in the phrase
itself. The phrase can then be regarded as negated.
The Prepositional Negation: The trigger is a phrase which requires a succeeding preposi-
tional phrase. The negated phrase is this prepositional phrase.
The Adjective Negation: Triggers are adjectives with capability of negating phrases in a
sentence.
The Verb Negation: This negation class is triggered by verbs.
In the following sections we describe, how our approach works and which pieces of information
of the grammar are used to support the decision process.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.957635">
4.2.1 The Adverbial Negation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975283071428572">
This first type of negation is a very common one. An adverb is the actual negation trigger. Its
occurence means, that the verb affected by this adverb negates a noun phrase, which is related
to the verb. Verbs work on subjects or objects in a sentence. The task is to correctly identify
this subject or object. That is, an adverb negates a noun phrase via a verb. The verb itself
is not the negated term, since a negation of a verb alone would not make sense. For example,
“not existing” says, that something does not exist. The important question is to identify the
thing that is not existent. Considering verbs as negated would on the other hand be a simple
and trivial task, since verbs always stand closely to the adverb working as trigger phrase. So,
a proper method of identifying related noun phrases is crucial. In CPGs, we have the triggers
“not” and “never” as adverbial triggers.
Negations using the trigger “not” are the most frequent negations in medical guidelines.
Nearly 50 % of all negations occuring in the observed twenty guidelines are triggered by this
term. Moreover, it is not only a very frequent trigger, it is also a very complex one. They do
not only underlie inflections due to varying tense and number but also to the active and passive
voice. This circumstances require a sophisticated treatment of this type of negation.
NegHunter uses the specific appearance of verb structures regarding their tense to decide,
whether a sentence contains an active or passive voice context. On this basis it decides, which
term is meant to be negated.
CHAPTER 4. NEGHUNTER 32
In order to clarify the considerations behind this way of proceeding, we provide a brief
summary of the active and passive voice.
The active voice: Here, the subject operates via the verb with the object in a specific way.
In the example
The radiogram identifies multiple calcifications in the left breast.
the subject “radiogram” comes via “identifies” with “multiple calcifications” into action.
The passive voice: Here, the subject itself is operated by the verb. When turning an
originally active form sentence into passive, the former object becomes the subject. For
example:
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.785563">
Multiple calcifications in the left breast are identified by the radiogram.
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.95677175">
Here, “multiple calcifications” are targeted by the verb structure “are identified” and
specified by the prepositional phrase “by the radiogram”.
These considerations allow the modelling of this kind of negations. When in the case of the
active voice a subject operates on an object, then, in the negated form, this object is excluded
from the operation. The negated object is the noun phrase following the concerning verb phrase.
NegHunter uses this information to identify the object.
In order to find out, if a verb structure is in active or passive voice, NegHunter uses infor-
mation of the verb combination to decide, which tense the verb structure has. Based on this
information we can see, whether the phrase is in active or passive voice.
The following two sentences explain the same matter of fact. Whereas, the first sentence is
written in active voice, the second is in passive voice. Both of them use the same tense (Past
Tense):

Thread&amp;gt; &lt;Passive Negation Trigger&amp;gt;
The definitions for this rule are the same as for the former rule, except for the negation
trigger. Its definition is as follows (see examples in Tables 4.7 to 4.10):
&lt;Passive Negation Trigger&amp;gt; ::_ (&lt;Be Verb&amp;gt; &lt;Adverb Trigger&amp;gt; &lt;Verb Phrase&amp;gt;)

The following example shows the result of the tagging process of a sentence in the active
voice with NegHunter:

As one can see in the tables above there are several decisions to be made in order to receive
the right tense. After this decision is made the negated concept represented by a noun is tagged.
This noun can be placed before or after the negation trigger depending on whether the verb
phrase is in active or passive form. In order to fully cover negated concepts we use a range of
three noun phrases tagged before or after the verb phrase. We have chosen a number of three
noun phrases in order to receive a good compromise between false-positive and false-negative
phrases. We believe that a negation covers only a small number of phrases and not a thread of
numerous phrases.
The next section deals with negations, where the triggers are already included in noun

contains the negated concept “randomisation”. In this case, the negation is triggered by the
term “without”. MMTx classifies “without randomisation” as a prepositional phrase.
NegHunter has classified four triggers for the Intra-Phrase Triggered Negation:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99947425">
1. without: occuring within a prepositional phrase
2. no: indicates negated noun phrases
3. inappropriate: within noun phrases
4. ineffective: also within noun phrases

<table confidence="0.734122">
The following rules are applied for the detection negated phrases of this type:
&lt;Adjective Negation&amp;gt; ::= &lt;Trigger Phrase&amp;gt; &lt;Noun Phrase&amp;gt;
&lt;Trigger Phrase&amp;gt; ::= “without”  |“no” |“inappropriate”  |“ineffective”
For example, in the sentence
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.919309263157895">
There is no clinical evidence that Hormone Replacement Therapy should be withheld
from patients with a history of cervical cancer
the concept “clinical evidence” is negated by the term “no”.
NegHunter identifies the negation triggers and afterwards it splits up the phrase allowing a
differentiation in negation trigger and negated term. The term which is contained in the phrase
with the trigger is then regarded as the negated phrase. In the subsequent sentence the effect
of the trigger “no” is shown:
There is no clinical evidence that Hormone Replacement Therapy should be with-
held from patients with a history of cervical cancer.2
In case of the negation with “without” the result would look similar:
Evidence obtained from at least one well-designed controlled study without randomisation .
All triggers are searched for with and without capital letters in order to also identify negations
placed at the beginning of a sentence.
The two triggers “ineffective” and “inappropriate” can also occur singularly in a sentence.
Related to the Intra-Phrase Triggered Negation they both are combined with other terms result-
ing in a noun phrase respectively a prepositional phrase. When this precondition is not given,
these two triggers are handled by the rules of the class “Adjective Negation”, explained in 4.2.4.

phrases are affected by negation triggers.

4.2.3 The Prepositional Negation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99493925">
The prepositional negation is initialized by certain phrases which require a following preposi-
tional phrase. Indeed, this prepositional phrase is the negated concept in the particular sentence.
Trigger phrases can either be nouns or adjectives.
For CPGs we use the subsequent terms initializing a prepositional negation:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999392">
• absence
• none
• lack
• free
• freedom
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.911582962962963">
Each of these phrases is followed by a prepositional phrase which is the negated phrase. The
following schema represents the rule for this type of negation:
&lt;Prepositional Negation&amp;gt; ::= &lt;Negation Trigger&amp;gt; &lt;Negated Phrase&amp;gt;
We apply the subsequent definitions:
&lt;Negation Trigger&amp;gt; ::= &lt;Noun Trigger&amp;gt; &lt;Adjective Trigger&amp;gt;
&lt;Noun Trigger&amp;gt; ::= “absence” “lack” “freedom”
&lt;Adjective Trigger&amp;gt; ::= “free” “none”
&lt;Negated Phrase&amp;gt; ::= &lt;Prepositional Phrase&amp;gt;
The sentence
Performing an anastomosis in this setting is dependent on the patient’s general con-
dition at the time of resection and the absence of other factors that indicate the
need for a stoma to be created.
shows an example of the usage of the trigger “the absence”. Although it is a prepositional
phrase it is considered as a negated phrase3. “The absence of other factor” equals the statement
“no other factors”, where “other factors” are the negated phrase (one must keep in mind, that
“no other factors” actually is an intra-phrase triggered negation, the comparison should only
simplify the understanding). With other verbs, negated phrases which are prepositional phrases
too are not treated as prepositional. They are negated phrases and therefore are also tagged as
such.
In the case of the trigger “lack” the tagging process is accomplished similarly:
The chemotherapy offered will depend on the duration of the response after receiving
first-line chemotherapy or the lack of response to first-line chemotherapy.
The last sentence allows a similar comparison as mentioned in the last example. The state-
ment “the lack of response to first-line chemotherapy” expresses the same fact as the statement
“there is no response to first-line chemotherapy”. Because of this, the prepositional phrase is
actually a negated phrase. Furthermore, the following example shows the effect of the trigger
“none”:

expresses the fact, that the semantic concept of the following phrase is not valid. Thus, the
phrase after “none” is considered as negated. In CPGs, this trigger term is often used in
sentence, where a related negated phrase does not exist. This is then the case, when the actual
negated phrase occur in a preceding sentence. For example,
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.835789" genericHeader="method">
AVAILABILITY OF COMPANION DOCUMENTS. None available
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998695259259259">
In this case, “AVAILABILITY OF COMPANION DOCUMENTS” is a headline, and in
the following paragraph the statement is expressed, that these companion documents are not
available. In this case, the trigger term is tagged, but the related phrase is not. We do not provide
a cross-sentence tagging, since this would lead to unpredictable results. Note the following
sentences:
There are many patients in the hospital. None has cancer.
In the hospital are many patients. None has cancer.
These two sentences are only simple ones, yet the negated phrases occur on different locations
within the sentences. When the sentence structure becomes more complex, these differences
grow larger. This makes a proper Negation Detection to a task of the second sight. Therefore,
NegHunter does not provide such tagging strategies.
There are also two triggers, which would not be regarded as triggers by persons not familiar
with the medical language. These triggers are “free” and “freedom”. In the normal spoken
or written language, the two terms always have a rather positive connotation. To be free of
something is always a good thing. This is also the case in medicine, but here, the freedom from
something means, that a specific concept could not be observed. The subsequent sentence shows
an example:
The patient is free of pain .
To be free of pain is a positive fact for the patient. In the context of medicine this sentence
also has the very important semantic of a lack of pain, i.e., there is no pain. This circumstances
make the terms “free” and “freedom” to important triggers. “Freedom” works similarly:
Freedom from pain is an important indicator for the recovery of a patient.
Here, pain is also negated by “freedom”. The presence of pain would otherwise lead to the
need of a treatment of the specific patient. This matter of fact is very important for CPGs.
In this class of negations prepositional information can also be added to a negated phrase.
When this case occurs, the prepositional phrase containing the addtional information is high-
lighted in cornflowerblue too, as shown in the following example:

4.2.4 The Adjective Negation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997273833333333">
English adjectives can also be used as negation triggers. For CPGs we identified the terms
“ineffective” and “inappropriate” as such triggers. The precondition of the usage of these two
adjectives as triggers is that they are not combined to a noun phrase with other terms (e.g.,
“Ineffective treatment of patients...”, see Subsection 4.2.2). This means, that the terms need
to occur singularly in a sentence. The following decision schema is applied for the adjective
negation:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.907819714285714">
&lt;Adjective Negation&amp;gt; ::= &lt;Negated Phrase&amp;gt; &lt;Arbitrary Phrase Thread&amp;gt; &lt;Be
Verb&amp;gt; &lt;Adjective Trigger&amp;gt;
The elements of this rule are defined as follows:
&lt;Negated Phrase&amp;gt; ::= &lt;Noun Phrase&amp;gt;
&lt;Arbitrary Phrase Thread&amp;gt; ::= &lt;Arbitrary Phrase except Noun Phrase&amp;gt;  |(&lt;Arbitrary

&lt;Adjective Trigger&amp;gt; ::= “ineffective”  |“inappropriate”
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9620519375">
The adjective trigger is preceded by a verb phrase indicating that this combination negates
the status of a phrase. Moreover, a number of arbitrary phrase can be located between this
combination and the noun phrase, which is negated. These arbitrary phrases must not be noun
phrases themselves. In
Recommendation indicates at least fair evidence that the service is ineffective or
that harm outweighs benefit.
the term “ineffective” occurs singularly in the sentence, indicating that the preceding phrase
is negated.
In the sentence
A superficial shave biopsy is inappropriate for suspicious pigmented lesions.
the trigger also occurs alone in the sentence. So, the phrase “A superficial shave biopsy” is
considered as a negated phrase.
The two triggers for the Adjective Negation can also occurs as triggers of another class of
negation types, as mentioned earlier. When one of these triggers appears within a noun phrase
or a prepositional phrase they are handled as an Intra-Phrase Triggered Negation. In this case
the rules described in Section 4.2.2 are applied.

4.2.5 The Verb Negation
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999637166666667">
Negations can also be triggered by verbs. If such a verb occurs in a sentence, the phrase related
to this verb is considered negated. According to the suffix we decide, whether a verb represents
an expression in the active or passive voice. For example, the suffix “ing” indicates the passive
voice (e.g., “A treatment option is lacking”), whereas the suffix “s” indicates the active voice
(e.g., “The patient lacks a good health status”). The decision rule for the verb negation is the
following:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.475095588235294">
&lt;Verb Negation Active Voice&amp;gt; ::= &lt;Active Verb Trigger&amp;gt; &lt;Negated Phrase&amp;gt;
CHAPTER 4. NEGHUNTER 40
Here, the negation trigger is defined as:
&lt;Active Verb Trigger&amp;gt; ::_ “lack” 1 “lacks” 1 “lacked” 1 “deny” 1 “denies” 1 “denied”
For the passive voice, the rule is:
&lt;Verb Negation Passive Voice&amp;gt; ::_ &lt;Negated Phrase&amp;gt; &lt;Passive Verb Trigger&amp;gt;
The negation trigger is a verb in its passive voice:
&lt;Passive Verb Trigger&amp;gt; ::_ “lacking” 1 “denying”
In both cases, the negated phrase is a noun phrase:
&lt;Negated Phrase&amp;gt; ::_ &lt;Noun Phrase&amp;gt;
We identified the two triggers “lack” and “deny” as such verb triggers. The following example
sentence shows the occurence of the trigger “lack” in active voice:
a good health status .
The patient lacks
Here, as the sentence is written in active voice, the triggers negateds the succeeding phrase
“a good health status”. In the passive voice, a preceding phrase is negated by the triggers:

4.2.6 Assigning Prepositional Information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.843203444444445">
With prepositional phrases auxiliary information is provided in many cases. From our point of
view it is important to label this additional pieces of information, since they deliver a specification
of a negated concept. We decided to tag all prepositional phrases which directly follow negated
phrases. In the sentence
Women who do the criteria for referral should be cared for in primary
not meet
care by giving standard written information.4
we see a prepositional phrase tagged in blue. In this case, only one preposition followed the
negated concept. In opposition to this case, in the following sentence more than one prepositional
phrase is added to the concept:
The use of anthracyclines in first line chemotherapy treatment
of epithelial ovarian cancer is not recommended outside randomised controlled tri-
als (RCTs )
For such cases we decided to tag all prepositional phrases which directly follow a concept.
Once the thread of prepositional phrases is split up by another type of phrase the affinity to the
concept is ended up and the tagging process stops too.
The following example shows prepositional information applied to an intra-phrase triggered
negation:

In this case we have two pieces of additional information added to the negated concept which
for that reason are also provided with metadata that signs them as belonging to the negated
phrase. The trigger “ineffective” shows a similar behaviour:
Ineffective of patients
treatment maximizes the costs.
In the class of prepositional negations, prepositonal information can also be added to the
negated phrase. When this case occurs, we discriminate between the negated phrase and the
added information. It is important that the prepositional negated phrase and the prepositional
information are not confused, since they are different concepts in the sentence. The following
sentence, already introduced in Section 4.2.3, shows such a case:
The chemotherapy offered will depend on the duration of the response after receiving
first-line chemotherapy or the lack of response to first-line chemotherapy.
Here the negated phrase and its added information are treated differently, although both
originate from the same lexical category.
Prepositional information represents an essential part of information that must also be de-
clared as belonging to the negated phrase. This kind of information often provides explanations
which must not be lost in the Negation Detection process.
The next section gives a summary over our developed approach and resumes our aggregated
knowledge.

4.3 Summary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967804888888889">
In the preceding section we described our Negation Detection method called NegHunter. NegHunter
uses the MMTx software as a framework for document and sentence analysis. The information
gained from the processing of CPGs with MMTx are used for the identification of the underlying
negation class. Each identified negation is matched to one of five defined negation categories,
which have been developed and named in regard to their syntactical features. This means, that
part-of-speech characteristics of the negation triggers themselves as well as their behaviour on
negated phrases are used for their naming. For example, the “adverbial negation” uses adverbs,
which affect a phrase via a verb and thus negate this phrase. “Adjective negation” as well as
“verb negation” can be understood straightforward, as in these types the triggers are either
adjectives or verbs. The “intra-phrase triggered negation” owes it’s name to the circumstance
that the triggers are contained in the phrase they negate. Yet, triggers can be of several lexical
categories, for example, “without” is a preposition, whereas “ineffective” is an adjective. The
“prepositional negation” is triggered by terms, which affecta subsequent prepositional phrase,
although they again can arise from several lexical categories (e.g. “lack” as a noun triggers a
prepositional negation as well as “free”, which is an adjective).
This negation classification allows a targeted detection of negated phrases. This approach is
necessary since CPGs are medical documents written in free speech, not restricted to conventions
that could be used for a simpler algorithm design. As each individual has an individual writing
style, all CPGs vary from from each other. NegHunter uses the basis of language itsel, so on
this way we are able to overcome the vast possibilities of variations.
CHAPTER 4. NEGHUNTER 42
We believe thanks to the general structure of our algorithms that a deployment of NegHunter
on documents different from CPGs can als be considered. NegHunter uses dealings of the English
language which may also be applicable for other writings.
In the following section we provide the evaluation of our system. In Chapter 6 we resume
our research and give a future outline of possible enhancements to our existing system.

The final part of our work on Negation Detection consists of the evaluation of our approach. With
this part we provide information about the performance of the presented algorithms. Moreover,
we show the distribution of occuring negated phrases with their underlying classification.
The evaluation was carried out as follows: we initially developed a gold standard of our test
set of totally 16 CPGs (see Section 1.2). In a second step we compared this gold standard with
the results of the processing with NegHunter. Afterwards, we calculated the statistical values of
recall and precision, which are generally used to evaluate Natural Language Processing systems
(see Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.3). Finally, we tried to identify errors in the tagging process which
emerged due to the MMTx framework and errors related to NegHunter.
In the subsequent section we give an overview over the distribution of the phrases we iden-
tified as negated in our test set of 16 CPGs.

5.1 Distribution of Identified Negated Phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999144">
In the 16 CPGs we used to test our negation detection algorithms we found 642 sentences
containing totally 731 negated phrases. Of these 731 negated phrases, an overwhelmingly large
number belonged to the class of the adverbial negation. This class of negation is not only the
most frequent class but also the most complicated to process. It is difficult to identify negations
of this type, since the concerning phrases can occur on the complete opposite end of the place of
the trigger in the sentence. Other types of negations are easier to treat, since the phrase related
to trigger is always expected subsequently to the trigger.
Figure 5.1 shows a pie chart of the distribution of negated phrases. As one can see the most
dominant class is the adverbial negation with a total of 69 % of all counted negations. Another
very frequent class is the intra-phrase triggered negation which holds one quarter of all phrases.
Prepositional negation and verb negation occur in 3 % and 2 %, respectively and the adjective
negation as the smallest class amounts to only 1 % of the detected negated phrases.
The vast amount of adverbial negations in CPGs has also a large effect on the outcome.
The complexity leads to difficulties in the identification of the actual negated phrases. As these
difficulties concern a negation class with a vast amount of occurences, overall recall and precision
are strongly influenced and consequently lowered. Good results of the other classes cannot
equalise this effect, because their number is too small. Alternatively, an efficient treatment of
this negation type has a positive impact on the overall parameters.
In the following section we give an impression of the performance of NegHunter in each
negation class. We show, how efficient NegHunter identifies negations of the different types.

5.2 Analysing the Performance of NegHunter
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99940125">
The analysis of the performance of NegHunter was carried out using the statistical parameters
recall and precision presented in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.3. The recall is a measurement for the
quality of a method to identify interesting targets. The following formula simplifies this matter
of fact:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.562084333333333">
P Identified Relevant Targets
Recall =
Z All Exisiting Relevant Targets
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.995075333333333">
On the other hand, the precision measures, how good a system discards elements of no inter-
est. It’s value gives information about how many irrelevant targets were (incorrectly) identified.
See the subsequent formula for a simplified represention:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.70032025">
P Identified Relevant Targets
Precision
=
Z All Identified Targets
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.991198696969697">
A high value in recall means that a detection method has nearly covered all interesting enti-
ties, a high value in precision means that no redundant entities have been identified. An illegal
way of maximizing recall would be to consider each and every entity in a writing as interest-
ing. Although in this case recall would become 100 %, a high amount of needless information
is detected too. Consequently, the value of precision would be very low (this depends on the
amount of available entities: if there are 100 entities in a document of which 99 are of interest,
then the consideration of all 100 entities as interesting would have high values in both recall
and precision). The same can be applied to precision: minimizing the false positive detection to
CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION 45
gain a high precision means that a lot of interesting pieces of information may have been lost
during the detection process.
To calculate the two parameters we also have to consider partially correct results. A result is
partially correct, if only a fraction of the whole entity could be correctly identified. For example,
if the result of a tagging process would be “surgery”, but the actual interesting target had been
“minimal invasive surgery”, this lack of a part of the original target would lead to one only
partially correct result. In this case, the results counts only half the value of a true positive.
The partially correctness is therefore a crucial element of the calculation for the analysis of the
performance of a method.
In order to evaluate the vast amount of sentences in CPGs containing negations, we imple-
mented a program to accomplish this task. This programm has as input a goldstandard CPG.
Within this CPG it searches for negation triggers. When a negation trigger is found, the whole
sentence is analysed for the negated phrases (which are already tagged since it is a goldstan-
dard) and the analysis results are stored. Afterwards, the taggings are removed. What remains
is the original sentence of the CPG before it was turned into the goldstandard. The original
sentence is now sent to NegHunter, which processes it. The processed sentence is then again
returned to the evaluation programm which analyzes it again and stores these results. Then,
both goldstandard results and NegHunter results are compared to eachother. The consequence
of this process is, that we afterwards have a number of true positive, false positive, false negative
and partially correct results. These numbers are stored and the analysis results of all sentences
in the guideline are added together, so we get overall true positives, false positives, etc.. The
results of each guideline is stored in a spreadsheet. After the processing of all test-CPGs we had
the true positives, false positives, etc. and calculated recall and precision with following two
formulas:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9972892">
Z TruePositives + 21 * Z PartiallyCorrects
Recall =
Z TruePositives + Z FalseNegatives + Z PartiallyCorrects
Precision =

In the part now following we give a detailled analysis of the performance of NegHunter in
each negation class.
The Adverbial Negation: This most frequent class of negation totally amounts to 507 negated
phrases, these are 69 % of all negated phrases. Of these phrases 75.54 % were correctly
identified, 19.92 % where missed by the detection algorithm and 4.54 % were detected only
partially correct.

In some cases, errors occured due to an incorrect part-of-speech tagging by the MMTx software.
MMTx is a very sophisticated software which leads to good results in the Natural Language
Processing.
CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION 48
In the adverbial negation, we could find the most errors (this class is the most frequent one).
We had 20 false positive, 21 false negative, and 15 partially correct results in that negation type.
The following sentence gives an example:
While the presence of some indicators such as perineural involvement or vascular
tumor emboli alone may not necessarily indicate a high risk of recurrence, ...
Here, the phrase “a high risk” is not properly identified by MMTx. While “a risk” is correctly
detected as a noun phrase, the combination with “high” leads to an incorrect result (MMTx
cannot identify “a high risk” and therefore regards it as an unknown phrase), which leads to a
false negative result in the evaluation. Another good example to show the limitations of MMTx
is this sentence:
Trials powered to detect specified differences in main outcomes may not have suffi-
cient power to detect adverse events that are less frequent.
In this sentence, MMTx detects the phrase “sufficient power to” as belonging together and
classifies it as a noun phrase. This wrong classification brings one more only partially correct
result for our evaluation.
In the intra-phrase triggered negation we had only five partially correct results. For example,
in
There was no systematic attempt to search for all the “grey literature” (conferences,
abstracts, theses and unpublished literature).
the actual negated phrase would be the “systematic attempt”. MMTx unfortunately appends
the “to” to this phrase, leading to a partially correct result.
In the verb negation we had a similar problem:
The panel lacked a consensus to recommend it.
In this example the term “to” is also appended to the actual negated phrase “a consensus”,
which generates an only partially correct result. In the class of verb negation, four partially
correct results were caused by MMTx. Table 5.8 shows the numbers of registered MMTx errors
related to their particular negation class, whereas Table 5.9 contains the relative number of
MMTx errors compared to the overall errors. In this table one can see that on overwhelmingly
large number of partially correct results is generated by MMTx itself (75 %), whereas only a
relative small number of false positive (7.55 %) and false negative (18.26 %) comes from MMTx.

5.2.2 Discussion
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999857">
The program shows its strength in the class of the intra-phrase triggered negation, the prepo-
sitional negation as well as the adjective negation. In the case of the intra-phrase triggered
negation and the prepositional negation this matter of fact emerges through the easy structure
of these classes. The concerned negated phrases occurs immediately after the trigger. Thus, a
proper handling of this type is not a problem.
The adverbial negation and the verb negation need more sophisticated strategies. In these
types verbs give information about where a phrase affected by a trigger can be. For the purpose
of a proper Negation Detecion, one has to keep the effect of different tenses in mind. The
knowledge of the tenses determines, whether a sentence is written in active or passive voice. On
this basis, a decision can be made, where the negated phrase occurs in a sentence. The problem
of finding negated phrases is also the fact that they can occur on positions far away from the
specific trigger. Due to this problem we have not only the failure of not detecting the phrase, but
also the failure of spuriously detecting phrases in the space between trigger and actual negated
phrase. Although a tagging scope of three phrases away from an adverbial trigger is a good
compromise between recall and precision, there nevertheless occur errors. We also had to place
value on the optimization of the recall of our method, as it is easier to remove mistakenly tagged
phrases afterwards as it is to find them again. Thus, we had to accept an increasing number of
false positive tagging, leading to a decreasing value in precision.
We believe that a Negation Detection using syntactical methods can improve the handling of
negations in medical writings. As we use methods which are also applicable in writings different
from medical documents, our approach can also be applied to documents in other domains.
It is imaginable, that an approach using full-parsing, which also regards the sentence position
of phrases can increase the performance of our algorithms. Moreover, the deployment of our
method of Negation Detection is also possible in a non-medical area, since our algorithms are
universally applicable for the English language. A restriction to the medical topic is therefore
not implicitly necessary.
A refinement for the search of negated phrases for a specific topic using semantic methods
is also possible. One could search for phrases which explicitly only concern the field of negative
recommendations, or otherwise, one could accomplish a search for diseases or conditions, in
which a certain CPG, respectively a part of it, is not applicable.

<bodyText confidence="0.999799484848485">
In our presented approach we use syntactical information of the English language to decide,
whether phrases in a sentence are affected by a negation trigger or not. The English grammar
provides with its tenses and parts-of-speech enough information to allocate potential negated
phrases. We use this information and created a classification system which contains five global
classes of negation, which are distinguished by their different grammatical type. Negations work-
ing on neutral (in the sense that they are not negation triggers themselves) verbs using adverbs
are therefore classified as “adverbial negation”, while negations using adjectives are referred to as
“adjective negations”, and negations triggered by verbs are “verb negations”. Furthermore, we
have two more types called “intra-phrase triggered negation” and the “prepositional negation”.
In the first case, the triggers are contained in the negated phrase itself, and can be of several
lexical categories (e.g., a preposition such as “without” or an adjective such as “ineffective”). In
the second case, the triggers concern subsequent prepositional phrases and are not assignable to
one specific lexical category too (e.g. the adjective “free” or the noun “lack”). Currently, our
system is strongly limited to syntactical features. As a future outline, the involvement of meth-
ods using semantical aspects is conceivable. On the current base of processing, a subsequent
deployment of semantical methods can augment the quality of Negation Detection and refine
search parameters for interested persons. Compare the following example of [Chapman et al.,
2001], which demonstrates negations with different contents that may be useful under different
circumstances:
We did not treat the infection.
We did not detect an infection.
The first sentence indicates the absence of the treatment of an infection. Nevertheless, this
infection is existent, whereas in the second sentence the existence of the infection itself is negated.
This slight difference may seem dispensable, but in the medical context it gets an importance
not negligible. With NegHunter’s syntactical methods in combination with a semantic level,
medical data can be obtained specifically. Whereas one may be interested in negated findings in
a certain CPG, another person maybe wants to find treatment options not advisable for special
circumstances. Therefore, NegHunter provides a broad basis for Negation Detection which can
be armed with special semantic concepts for any medical topic of interest.
Another option of including semantic into the Negation Detection is the observance of terms
which are capable of modifying the strength of a negation. In our approach, the detection is a
binary decision, i.e., a phrase can either be negated or not. In some cases, this binary method
may not be sufficient. For example, in the sentence

CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSION 51
the term “Chemotherapy” is negated, but the term “always” softens this absolute negation.
In other words, chemotherapy is not recommended in the most cases (for example, when the
physiological status of a person is extremly bad), anyhow, it can be appropriate under certain
circumstances. As practitioners are strongly advised to critically adopt CPGs, the presentation
of this type of information can therefore also be necessary.
Furthermore, we decided to chose a flexible implementation of our method in order to make
it portable to arbitrary documents. Thanks to NegHunter’s classification of negations, an aug-
mentation of already available negation triggers is always possible, thus making the system
applicable for the usage in other types of documents. The new trigger only has to be assigned to
a negation class and NegHunter then applies it’s rulebase for this trigger. This makes NegHunter
portable on other documents types as well as extensible and maintainable.
Our system provides methods for a targeted detection of negations, thus making it capable
of processing even CPGs, which under different circumstances are difficult to handle, since they
are written in free speech. Former approaches lack these features, so NegHunter makes a great
contribution for the topic of automated processing of CPGs. Thus, it aids the handling of CPGs
and alleviates their deployment in the practical field.

<abstract confidence="0.9991039">Medical information is often stored in a narrative way, which makes the automated processing a difficult and time-consuming task. Persons responsible for the authoring of medical documents do not take care of a further processing with automated systems. So, information stored in medical writings is not directly usable for the processing with computers. Due to this, efforts have been made to transfer these narrative documents in a format easier processable with computers. This matter of fact also applies to clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). As many medical documents, CPGs are written in a narrative speech as well, without regards to a computer-assisted processing. For the implementation of CPGs in medical facilities an automated processing is therefore desirable. An important fact is that a lot of information in CPGs is provided in a negated form, expressing that certain circumstances in patients or treatments are not available, existing or applicable. Although negated, this information is nevertheless very useful, since it can express the absence of certain conditions or diseases in patients. Moreover, negations can describe which treatment options should not be taken into account for a given patient, helping a practising physician or nurse in his/her decision process for the assortment of a proper treatment. Thus, a proper Negation Detection in CPGs is an important task for the automated processing of this type of medical documents. It helps to accelerate the decision making process and can support medical staff in their care for patients. We developed algorithms capable of Negation Detection in CPGs. We use syntactical methods provided by the English language to achieve a precise detection of occuring negations. According to our results we are convinced that the involvement of syntactical methods can improve Negation Detection, not only in medical writings but also in arbitrary narrative texts. ii Kurzfassung Medizinische Daten werden in der Regel in natürlicher Sprache abgespeichert. Dies liegt daran, dass medizinisches Personal im Normalfall keine Rücksicht auf eine spätere Verarbeitung in automatisierten Systemen nimmt. Die Informationen sind daher nicht sofort für eine Verarbeitung mit Computern verfügbar. Aus diesem Grund wurden vielfach Anstrengungen unternommen, um die Daten in ein für Computer verarbeitbares Format überzuführen. Dieser Umstand gilt auch für medizinische Leitlinien (sogenannte “Clinical Practice Guidelines” (CPGs)). Sie sind, wie alle medizinischen Dokumente, ebenfalls in natürlicher Sprache verfaßt, ohne Rücksichtnahme auf eine computergestützte Verarbeitbarkeit. Die Einführung von medizinischen Leitlinien im klinischen Umfeld macht allerdings eine automatisierte Verarbeitung wünschenswert. In diesem Zusammenhang muß weiters beachtet werden, dass ein großer Teil der Information in medizinischen Leitlinien in negierter Form vorhanden ist. Die Tatsache, dass diese negiert vorliegt, macht sie aber deswegen nicht irrelevant oder weniger beachtenswert. Im Gegenteil, oftmals werden auf diese Art und Weise ungeeignete Behandlungsverfahren gekennzeichnet, beziehungsweise Behandlungen, die bei gegebenen physiologischen Zuständen nicht durchgeführt werden sollen oder dürfen. Solche Informationen können den Behandelnden helfen, die richtigen Therapieverfahren anzuwenden oder auch gewisse Verfahren abzulehnen. Dementsprechend ist die Erfassung von Negationen (die sogenannte “Negation Detection”) in medizinischen Leitlinien ein essentieller Bestandteil für die automatisierte Weiterverarbeitung dieser Art von medizinischen Dokumenten. Entscheidungsprozesse werden somit beschleunigt und dies wirkt sich positiv auf die Behandlung der Patienten aus. Um diese Aufgabe zu lösen haben wir Algorithmen entwickelt, die das Auffinden von Negationen in medizinischen Leitlinien ermöglichen sollen. Dazu benutzen wir syntaktische Verfahren, die die englische Grammatik gezielt ausnützen, um aufgetretene Negationen exakt aufzuspüren. Unsere gewonnenen Resultate zeigen, dass die Verwendung syntaktischer Methoden dabei hilft, die Identifikation von Negationen zu verbessern, wobei unsere Methoden nicht nur auf medizinische Dokumente, sondern auf jede Art von natürlichsprachlichem Text anwendbar sind.</abstract>
