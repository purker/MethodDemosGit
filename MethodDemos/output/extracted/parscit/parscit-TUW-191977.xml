Abstract. Digital Library (DL) interoperability requires addressing a variety of
issues associated with functionality. We report on the analysis and solutions
identified by the Functionality Working Group of the DL.org project during its
deliberations on DL interoperability. Ultimately, we hope that work based on
our perspective will lead to improved architectures and software, as well as to
greater interoperability, for next-generation DL systems.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977578947368">
A huge volume of information and knowledge is acquired and managed by distinct
Digital Libraries (DLs). This leads to problems for academic and public libraries that
often work with scores of such DLs and seek to support patrons facing a broad range
of systems and services. Similar problems are faced by students, faculty, researchers,
scholars, knowledge workers, and the general public. Also of concern is e-science,
where labs and centers must use different DLs to address global challenges.
Interoperability among all the DLs needed in each case is a serious concern.
Manifesting a broad range of features and capabilities, DL systems employ diverse
proprietary solutions and varying applications of a broad range of standards. The
problem is further aggravated by the complexity and scale of modern DL systems and
problems such as API mismatch, data format mismatch, and missing components.
Interoperability has been the main issue of concern for the DL.org project [4]. Its
work is based on the DELOS Digital Library Reference Model [3], in particular, the
multi-dimensional representation of the DL domain and the identification of six
primary concepts that characterize Digital Libraries: content, users, functionality,
policy, quality, and architecture. In this paper, we present results from the discussions
of the DL.org Functionality Working Group [4]. This Working Group is focusing on
interoperability with respect to one of these concepts, DL functionality, while still
remaining within the broader context of the entire DL space.

2 Functions, Interoperability, and Compatibility
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986184461538462">
There are many definitions of function. The Reference Model defines function as: “an
action a DL component or a DL user performs” [3]. In software engineering, a
function is a portion of code or a module that performs a specific task (or action); it is
embedded within a larger program but remains relatively independent from the rest of
the code. Function interoperability is often concerned with software modules that
implement a DL function. The mathematical definition of a function as a mapping
from a domain to a range is not important here.
Function interoperability is of particular importance in DLs, as indicated in Table
1. Such interoperability serves three main purposes: i) To provide users of one DL
access to the content and functionality of other DLs; ii) To harmonize the user
experience provided by different DLs so that the user who has learned to use one DL
can use other DLs easily; iii) To save effort in creating new DLs or adding
functionality to existing DLs, by reusing existing software components.

<bodyText confidence="0.993478666666667">
To achieve interoperability of functions, one may use a registry that allows for the
discovery of software modules that implement sought-after functionality in a given
software context for a given user group. Such a registry should show the different
ways in which functions can be interoperable.
From a system-based point of view, three important ways to achieve function
interoperability are the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.961512222222222">
1. Based on processing (e.g., function Fa may utilize the functionality offered by
another function Fb either by directly incorporating the provided functionality
within Fa or by calling it as an external service);
2. Based on data/content (e.g., the outcome of function Fa is da which is used by
Fb as input via direct exchange / conversion / replacement);
3. Based on cross-function compatibility (e.g., functions Fa and Fb have the same
interface).
From a user point of view there are issues related to functionality that concern the
compatibility of products. Such compatibility is directional and can be expressed in
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.894042">
two levels. More formally, DL B is product-compatible with DL A with respect to
functionality if the following hold:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99385">
1. DL B provides all functions that DL A provides (product compatibility with
respect to functions provided),
2. DL B uses the same interface with DL A to invoke functions, where interface
refers to names of functions, shape and color of buttons, screen layout, command
names, and syntax (full product compatibility).
From a framework based point of view, function interoperability requires:
1. an entity-relationship schema,
2. a taxonomy of the ways in which functions can interoperate, and
3. a template for the description of functions and software components.
</listItem>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.759892" genericHeader="method">
3 Specifications, Solutions, and Ontologies
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9651075">
A function specification, using a template such as the following, facilitates identi-
fication of what a function does and how a system or a human may interact with it.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9994031">
• Function Behavior: providing a description of what a function does and of the
supported interaction with actors (systems/users)
• API/Interface Specification: illustrating the Input and Output data and
parameters, data formats/standards, pre-conditions and post-conditions
• Dependencies/Relationships/Use: detailing the operating environment in
which a function runs; other functions needed; functions that invoke this
function; composite functions and workflows
• Interoperability Concerns: documenting what is required for interoperability
and how does a specific implementation meet these requirements
• Performance evaluation, assessment, and advice for use
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998621272727273">
Specifications of many of the above properties can use existing widely used
standards such as IDL, WSDL, SAWSDL, OWL-S, WSMO, or BPEL4WS.
Clearly, there are generic concerns regarding interoperability of functions that cut
across all types of software systems and others that are particular to DLs. A function
can be implemented as a service; thus the Service Oriented Computing (SOC) domain
is of particular interest. In that context, there are already proposed static and dynamic
solutions. Static solutions can be found in the e-Framework (www.e-framework.org)
or the RosettaNet community (www.rosettanet.org). Both initiatives accommodate a
standards-based service-oriented approach with well-defined services that facilitate
the whole range of the functionality and provided features. On the other hand,
dynamic solutions address several of the specified issues and rely on the use of
formally defined theories for the automated provision of adapters. Adapters handling
incompatibilities (e.g., with interfaces, behavior, and pre/post conditions) have been
developed by the SOC research community [1, 2]. These two distinctive types of
solutions can serve as the basis for DL function interoperability as well.
Another important aspect when dealing with interoperability is that functions can
be related in various ways, including the common relationship of sub-function. As
Table 2 shows, the standard DL function “search” has many sub-functions, especially
when advanced search is concerned. Thus, it is essential that taxonomic or, even
better, ontological descriptions of DL functions be provided. A thorough treatment of
this matter is given elsewhere [5], using the 5S framework; other work involves
ontology mappings, alignments, and merging [6].

4 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.916743555555555">
The Functionality Working Group of the DL.org project has explored issues,
approaches, and solutions related to the interoperation of DL functions. Essential are
appropriate description mechanisms and registries that will facilitate the publication
and discovery of functions. More work is also needed on function taxonomies and
ontologies, function composition, and the relationship to interoperability of the other
DL concepts, as addressed by other DL.org Working Groups.
