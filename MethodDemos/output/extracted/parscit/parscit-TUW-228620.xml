Abstract Business networking relies on application-specific
quantity and quality of information in order to support social
infrastructures in, e.g., energy allocation coordinated by smart
grids, healthcare services with electronic health records, traffic
management with personal sensors, RFID in retail and logis-
tics, or integration of individuals’ social network information
into good, services, and rescue operations. Due to the increas-
ing reliance of networking applications on sharing ICT ser-
vices, dependencies threaten privacy, security, and reliability
of information and, thus, innovative business applications in
smart societies. Resilience is becoming a new security ap-
proach, since it takes dependencies into account and aims at
achieving equilibriums in case of opposite requirements. This
special issue on &apos;Security and Privacy in Business Networking&apos;
contributes to the journal &apos;Electronic Markets&apos; by introducing a
different view on achieving acceptable secure business net-
working applications in spite of threats due to covert channels.
This view is on adapting resilience to enforcement of IT
security in business networking applications. Our analysis
shows that privacy is an evidence to measure and improve
trustworthy relationships and reliable interactions between
participants of business processes and their IT systems. The

Business networking and resilience
At present, one of the most promising visions for business
networking is the exploitation of information with information
and communication technology (ICT), in particular by Big
Data analytics with cyber-physical systems (CPS) (acatech
2011; Wahlster and Müller 2013). IBM calls it ‘Smarter
Planet’ (IBM Corporation 2008), the European Commission
(2010) has started the corresponding program ‘Horizon 2020—
A Digital Agenda for Europe’, and Japan proposes the
‘Declaration to be the World’s Most Advanced IT Nation’
(Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet 2013). One aim of
these initiatives is that systems, such as business networking
applications, social infrastructures, and a society become resil-
ient. Changes and vulnerabilities should be identified and
analyzed to foresee and prevent incidents of any kind, as well
as to react accordingly in acceptable time. Resilient ICT then
supports the increased, sustainable welfare of a society.
The key approach for gaining information on vulnerabil-
ities and predicting incidents will be the ability to access and
to analyze huge amounts of data in nearly real-time and to
implement so-called Big Data analytics successfully. Service
providers will collect, aggregate, and analyze data from vari-
ous sources provided by CPS, e.g., business networks, social

networks, sensors and actuators, as well as governments and
citizens. Prominent examples for such innovative business
networking applications can be found, e.g., in the domain of
energy allocation coordinated by smart grids, healthcare ser-
vices with electronic records, traffic management with per-
sonal sensors and interconnected vehicles, RFID in retail and
logistics, individualized manufacturing of goods, as well as
personalized services based on an individual’s social network.
Such business networking applications share the Internet
and its ICT services for global communication. Due to the
increasing interdependence of the participating components,
incidents may result in highly disruptive impacts. Technical
failure, human error, accidents, or cyber-attacks might spread
via dependencies and could threaten security and reliability of
ICT services, the supported social infrastructures, and, in the
end, the welfare and safety of our society. In order to improve
the security and reliability of ICT support in this context,
several approaches are currently being discussed and imple-
mented. For example, the reform of the EU legal framework
for electronic communications added Article 13a addressing
security and reliability. It asks public and private service
providers to take security measures and provide an incident
report flow as an information exchange on vulnerabilities and
incidents between providers, national regulatory authorities,
the European Union Agency for Network and Information
Security (ENISA), and the European Commission. It is pro-
posed that a qualified independent body should audit this
information flow. The vision is that such an information
exchange of incident reports would safeguard competition
and boost consumer choice (European Commission 2009).
For improving resilience, a spontaneous exchange of infor-
mation of acceptable quantity and quality lies at the core of
these approaches. While such extensive information exchange
and analysis can already be observed in business networking
applications (Riemer et al. 2009) in the context of security and
reliability it is still in an early stage. However, it would enable
service providers to derive information on vulnerabilities and
incidents by means of a secondary use of data with machine
learning algorithms. In turn such information can be disclosed
to other participants, e.g. actuators, who decide and act on this
information to improve the security of their services and ICT.
On the whole, such service providers and their business net-
working applications might be of high relevance for improv-
ing resilience of critical infrastructures, the emerging CPS,
and future business networks.
However, information exchange is also the basis for de-
pendencies between ICT systems—not only in the desired
way as realized in business networking applications, but also
by creating undesirable vulnerabilities and risks.
Unfortunately, not all dependencies of an ICT system can be
automatically detected (Wang and Ju 2006) and, thus, they
threaten trustworthiness and participation in an information
exchange. Therefore, one key issue to be resolved for
exploiting the full potential of future business networking is
enforcing the individual security and privacy interests of all
participants to achieve an acceptable trustworthy information
exchange. This implies controlling the usage of information.
Information exchange and intermediaries
In computer science trustworthy information exchange means
a reduction of vulnerabilities in the participating ICT systems
and their communication in order to reduce the effect of any
incident (Avizienis et al. 2004). It also means that participants
can formalize a security policy describing their individual
security interests and negotiate on an agreed-upon security
policy reflecting a compromise or equilibrium respectively
(Rannenberg et al. 1999). In such multilateral IT security
models protection goals, like accountability and
unobservability, become an important part of a ‘balanced’
security. Enforcing accountability and unobservability can
be technically achieved by encryption and authentication
schemes supporting pseudonymity, e.g. by identity manage-
ment (Chaum 1985) or cryptographic key systems (Pfitzmann
and Hansen 2010). These approaches depend on confidenti-
ality and integrity of the private key, its accountability to the
given identity, and on integrity and consistency of a public key
exchange. Even though trusted runtime environments exist
(Asokan et al. 2013), security of a cryptographic key ex-
change without a trusted third party (TTP) has not yet been
demonstrated (Freire et al. 2013).
Introducing a third party extends the direct communication
model of an information exchange. In practice, the role of a
third party acting as an intermediary for an information ex-
change is manifold. Intermediaries take care of the security
and reliability of the communication and of current payments.
Successful examples are SWIFT and international clearing
systems (Bons et al. 2012). Intermediaries also establish rela-
tionships between data providers and data consumers by de-
riving information based on data collected with their consent.
Successful examples here are loyalty card programs in the
field of customer relationship management (CRM) or social
networks sites. Furthermore, intermediaries can contribute to
the usability of an information exchange to enforce the par-
ticipants’ individual security interests. Usability studies of
security tools, e.g. PGP (Whitten and Tygar 1999), show that
their user interfaces and security concepts are too technical
and not intuitive with the result that, as observed in Germany,
over 70 % are willing to delegate responsibility for their
security to a TTP (DIVSI 2012).
Altogether, intermediaries in the role of TTP can be ex-
pected to play an important role with respect to extensive
information exchange. However, they also represent a new
vulnerability. Since an intermediary is usually involved in
several information exchanges with different participants,
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.726539">
Security and privacy in business networking
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99970472815534">
dependencies between the intermediary’s ICT system and
those of the other participants arise during run-time. Hence,
a TTP also can be the origin of a possible man-in-the-middle
attack with serious consequences for the information ex-
change. According to Article 13a incident reports in 2013,
third party failure has a high impact. Most of the observed
incidents have their direct cause in system overload, power
cuts, and software bugs (Dekker et al. 2013). The IT security
report for Germany in 2011 (BSI 2011) shows a trend from
direct attacks to indirect ones via dependencies to the affected
ICT system. The report forecasts an increase in attacks by
botnets, identity theft, security vulnerabilities, and malware.
SCADA, mobile communications, interfaces and storage me-
dia, or Cloud Computing systems — all of which are consid-
ered to be part of future CPS — show an increased risk
potential. A current study of Internet usage in Germany indi-
cates that these threats represent a real hurdle for information
exchange. A fear of misuse ofpersonal data is the main reason
why the majority of the population in Germany refrains from
participating in Internet services (DIVSI 2012).
Intermediaries can be expected to play a central role in
future business networks in the context of providing privacy
and security. However, they have to be trusted and, in other
words, the less trust required, the better. Therefore, security
and privacy mechanisms with a focus on intermediaries and
their dependencies as origins of incidents are of interest for
exploiting an effective information exchange in business net-
works. In respect of the realization of an incident report flow,
there is no incentive to provide vulnerability information or to
report incidents without adequate protection of the disclosed
information. For example, a participant reporting a breach of
confidentiality would be harmed twice: firstly by the incident
itself and secondly by a loss of reputation due to the leakage of
the confidential report.
Security models and their enforcement
The security approach to protect information once it has been
disclosed to a third party is isolation on the part of the third
party. Isolation means that exchanged information should not
come into contact with other information exchanges and that
the intermediary should not know what information is used in
the service or the purpose for which the service is being used
by its consumers (Sonehara et al. 2011). Thus, enforcement of
isolation means to implement a multilateral trust model to
enforce an equilibrium concerning the individual security
interests of the participants.
Individual security interests can be enforced by different
security models as described in the following. At first, access
control models formalize isolation by information flow con-
trol for a closed group of participants. Mandatory access
control (MAC) security models, e.g. Biba, Bell-LaPadula, or
the Chinese Wall Security Policy, are in widespread use
(Samarati and de Capitani di Vimercati 2001). They model
information flow control to protect data by the use of labels
and a pre-defined order. The pre-defined order classifies data
and identity of authorized participants as subjects into access
classes and formalizes the properties on data access as provi-
sions according to the protection goals of confidentiality or
integrity, respectively. However, the protection goal availabil-
ity of information might not be achieved easily if a MAC
policy is deployed for a spontaneous information exchange:
the pre-defined order of the security policy would have to be
implemented for service providers, leading to confidentiality
of the data but also to a restriction of the availability of the
services. Hence, a security configuration based on MAC may
lead to an incident on availability of information.
Discretionary access control (DAC) where authorizations
are granted to the identity of authorized service providers (data
consumers) and not according to a security class, is more
flexible. However, to date, DAC approaches are not precise
enough for a trustworthy spontaneous information exchange.
Granting access to data for given exchanges needs to define a
group or role for the participants. This, in turn, could grant
access to parties of an information exchange who are not
participating in it representing a vulnerability regarding con-
fidentiality and integrity of the information exchange.
In contrast, the concept of distributed usage control specifies
the confidentiality and integrity of an information exchange
and, thus, information flows as data processing by obligations
without restricting availability of information (Pretschner et al.
2006). The classification of Hilty et al. (2005) for obligations
according to time and distribution shows that obligations are in
general not enforceable but can become so at runtime.
Concluding, an instance of a security model for a given
isolation formalizes access on data and information, which is
mapped to the identities of authorized subjects. According to
the security model, security and privacy would be achieved if
only authorized identities get access to the information as
specified by provisions and obligations of the corresponding
security policy and if these identities did in fact represent the
corresponding data consumers. Their enforcement is to pre-
vent incidents and to close vulnerabilities.
A further relevant issue for realizing a trustworthy infor-
mation exchange is the authenticity of the exchanged infor-
mation. Authenticity of derived information is always subject
to a given error probability. Firstly, this is conceptually due to
application-dependent statistical model of machine learning
schemes (Domingos 2012). Secondly, information relates to a
given model, i.e. to a given context, e.g., described by service
level agreements and security policies specifying the context
of a data processing.
At present, two opposing security concepts for enforcing
isolation are under discussion: transparency and control.
Transparency of data processing as stated by Information
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.995514941176471">
Accountability (Weitzner et al. 2008) follows the concept that
data processing should be observed and evaluated with
Transparency-Enhancing Technology (TET). TET aims at
identifying an incident and its cause in order to decide on
the accountability and trustworthiness of the affected partici-
pant. In contrast, control on data processing as with Privacy by
Design (European Commission 2010) considers the possibil-
ity of a violation of an isolation and aims at enforcing
unobservability. Privacy-Enhancing Technology (PET)
achieves at least unobservability by pseudonymity. For self-
protection further PETs follow the approach of additionally
impeding secondary use of information and re-identification
of participants for purposes of data processing, which occur
after data collection. This may raise additional incidents and,
thus, requires transparency in their cause and origin to decide
on trustworthiness of the participants.
TET and dependencies
TET aims at enforcing obligations for isolation by observing
the current data processing and its compliance to a given
security policy. If a policy violation occurs, an anomaly and
its cause are analyzed to decide on accountability. It can
establish whether the received information has been processed
according to the corresponding security policy. A monitor
observes data processing of an ICT system and logs it for a
data protection audit (Karjoth et al. 2002). If enforcement of
isolation of previous information exchanges and vulnerabil-
ities of the ICT system of the data consumer are known, a data
provider then can derive information about expected enforce-
ment of isolation.
Data leakage prevention aims at confidentiality of data
processing. However, a monitor cannot consider more than
one trace and is vulnerable to covert channels as seen by
virtualization in Cloud Computing (Ristenpart et al. 2009).
This is an example of the vulnerability of data confidentiality
via a dependency even though the service provider grants
access to his services to authorized identities only. If confi-
dentiality is not the highest priority for an information ex-
change but rather integrity, consensus protocols are an ap-
proach to tolerate incidents while resulting in a consensus of
authentic information. Preferably different implementations of
the same information exchange run in parallel. Consensus
protocols assume an information exchange also between these
implementations, e.g. by an unknown, inevitable dependency.
However, it is impossible for consensus protocols to result in a
consensus in the asynchronous timing model, if only one of
the participating systems fails during the protocol run (Fischer
et al. 1985). Adding extensions such as randomization, failure
detectors, or strong primitives for shared-memory lead to
consensus protocols coping with failed systems due to delayed
or failed data transfer but not for malicious incidents. This is
the case with timing restricting consensus protocols (Gärtner
1999). Consensus protocols for a synchronous model cope
with failed systems up to a certain number of compromised
ICT systems, even if they send different messages to other
systems (Pfitzmann and Waidner 1992). However, they re-
strict availability of the participating ICT systems. This is a
vulnerability for any other information exchange with a de-
pendency on this ICT system and out of the scope of the threat
model of consensus protocols.
Latest research approaches aim at retaining detected anom-
alies by evidence on the current model of data processing. That
means they reconstruct the current model but without restricting
availability. Secure logging and evidence (Sackmann et al.
2006) consider transparent data processing of separated ICT
systems and restrict access to logged data to authorized identi-
ties only. Process mining (Van der Aalst 2012) extends moni-
toring of the activities of an information exchange between ICT
systems. The assumptions are completeness and authenticity of
logged events, whereas confidentiality of the logged data in
accordance to granting access on these observations to autho-
rized identities is assured (Accorsi 2011). Avariation ofprocess
mining is data provenance, which also documents the history of
data and additionally their value by ‘sticking’ it to the data and
derived information (Buneman et al. 2001). Schemes are inver-
sion of data processing and annotation of data. Inversion de-
pends on knowledge of the granted access decisions and the
output data. This relates to the same completeness assumption
as for secure logging and process mining. Annotation labels
data so that the model of data processing can be re-constructed
if a mapping to the data exists. However, current means for data
provenance by annotation either assume centralized monitoring
of the complete information exchange or are suitable for some
kind of data without the derived information. Furthermore, data
provenance can detect an information leakage and its cause
only if the leaked information has been found together with
evidence on its history (Wohlgemuth et al. 2010).
Data provenance and secure logging as a components for
each ICT system under investigation can in principle be used to
check the integrity and origin of information by the reconstructed
model and its comparison to the security policy. This recon-
structed model in turn should extend the model of the applied
machine learning scheme. In order to detect an identity theft, it
may not be sufficient to reconstruct the model of this data
processing, since it ends at the identity. It may also be necessary
to check whether an anomaly in the usage of this identity exists
regarding the information exchange under investigation.
PET and dependencies
After converting obligations into provisions, PET enforces
them while considering violations of confidentiality of isola-
tion. The assumption is an idealized threat model assuming
ICT systems as being correct whereas trustworthiness of par-
ticipants is uncertain. PET impedes re-identification,
Security and privacy in business networking
secondary use, and non-authorized profiling according to the
master identity of a participating party. It can be achieved by
restricting availability of information or the information itself
(Gilliot et al. 2009). This, in turn, threatens Big Data analytics
with an increase of its error probability by introducing faulty
information or the non-availability of sufficient quantity,
whereas this does not depend on the type of machine learning
scheme (Biggio et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2011).
Encryption protects information before access has taken
place. However, after decryption, protection is no longer
provided and information can be leaked via an unknown
dependency. Identity management with anonymized creden-
tials achieves accountability and unobservability as long as
further disclosure to third parties is not considered
(Camenisch and Lysanskaya 2001). A non-linkable delegation
of rights achieves unobservability and accountability in an
information exchange with an intermediary under the assump-
tion that the modeled recipient of the information as the last
data consumer in its exchange is trustworthy and its ICT
system has no vulnerability (Wohlgemuth and Müller 2006).
However, this is not realistic for a spontaneous information
exchange with an intermediary.
Our analysis of dependencies in a spontaneous information
exchange and today’s mechanisms to enforce its security model
in accordance with the security and privacy interests of the
participants shows that an incident and its propagation to a
secure ICT system is always possible. On one hand, it is possible
that an attacker can control the identity of this participant. On the
other hand, strengthening transparency by consensus protocols
or confidentiality by PET with reducing the information raises
an incident on dependent information exchanges.
Homomorphic encryption schemes (Dolev and Yao 1983)
enforce confidentiality and integrity of information and, at the
same time, preserve its availability. Their general suitability is
uncertain due to their required computing performance of the
cryptographic scheme and a mismatch in abstraction of the
information (Naehrig et al. 2011).
Resilience as an approach for IT security and privacy
At present security and privacy in business networking is based
on a system and threat model, which includes a limited set of
possible information exchanges and incidents. It considers
expected states and dependencies including those, which have
already passed. A partial model can be achieved for any sub-
system, which does not change for an adequate time. However,
this is not reality for many actual business networking applica-
tions which are highly dynamic and agile. Since vulnerabilities
from dependencies arise during run-time and cannot be
completely known and predicted, the ‘pure’ model-based ap-
proach is not adequate for preventing and reacting in this
context. It is not (at least not efficiently) possible to model all
possible changes and incidents and, thus, security with ‘pure’
model-based approaches will have to follow changes in busi-
ness networks and their underlying technology.
Extending ‘pure’ model-based security and privacy ap-
proaches to the dynamic and unforeseeable context of actual
business networking means having to address these vulnerabil-
ities and dependencies. The general view then changes from
achieving ‘pure’ security to preserving an acceptable level of
service of a system that corresponds to a compromise of the
individual security and privacy interests of the participants in an
information exchange. Preserving an acceptable level of service
of a system requires constantly adapting its dependencies to
incidents (Holling 2001), a concept that is also known as
resilience. However, a general statement on the resilience of a
system cannot be made. It corresponds to a certain incident and
the ability of a system to recover within a certain time for
response and composite costs and risks (Haimes 2009). Since
neither individual security and privacy interests (and compro-
mises) nor vulnerabilities remain identical over time, an adap-
tion of security and privacy enforcement is required.
Thus, it is worth thinking about improving security and
privacy in business networking by using methods and tools
that support resilience of social infrastructures, i.e. in particu-
lar Big Data analytics and information exchange on incidents.
For data providers and data consumers approaches are re-
quired that allow both to balance the benefit and the level of
service, respectively, the security or privacy risk associated
with information exchange. This means that, e.g., a data
provider should be able to check before an information ex-
change takes place whether a data consumer might violate
obligations for the information exchange. Vice versa, a data
consumer should be able to check a priori of an information
exchange whether the received information is the expected
one and the data provider has followed the agreed-upon
security policy for this information exchange. From an eco-
nomic theory point of view, this leads to an asymmetric
information situation that can usually be solved (or at least
improved) by signalling or screening mechanisms (Furubotn
and Richter 2005). Thus, new technical approaches that ad-
dress the reduction of information asymmetry are being
discussed as suitable methods and tools for improving security
and privacy in business networking.
ICT Resilience — a signaling and screening architecture
To empower data providers and data consumers to assess and
balance the benefit and risk of entering an information ex-
change, classical security methods and tools should be
complemented by methods and tools that support their decision
making. To reduce information asymmetry, signalling compo-
nents should give a participant a tool to generate evidence on
his actual data usage to prove trustworthiness according to the
corresponding obligations, as well as establish a reputation over

several information exchanges. In turn, a screening component
should give a participant a tool to prove that exchanged infor-
mation has been used as intended (or not). These tools are to be
combined with accountability and an (economic) incentive
system that allows each participant to evaluate the value of an
information exchange according to the security configuration,
the achievable level of, e.g. unobservability or accountability,
and individual risk preferences.
In accordance with our analysis and adapting current ap-
proaches for resilience to security and privacy in business
networking, we use the following five components to catego-
rize methods and tools, as well as open research issues for ICT
Resilience.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.862031">
• A Usage Control Policy Tool Box aims at formalizing

<bodyText confidence="0.8721482">
isolation patterns for expected information exchanges
and anti-isolation patterns for classes of anomalies of an
isolation. On one hand, this is required for expressing the
interest of the parties involved in an information ex-
change. On the other hand, this is a basis for detecting
anomalies, incidents, and policy violations, as well as for
generating correct incident reports and their exchange.
The set of patterns should be extensible to cater for newly
detected patterns during runtime and for previously un-
known interferences and results.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.881602709677419">
• Privacy Control aims at self-protecting against informa-
tion leakage. The real identities of data providers should
remain unobservable when information is going to be
disclosed to third parties. This requires, e.g., identity man-
agement supporting pseudonymity and non-linkable del-
egation of rights. Pseudonymity should be revocable in
case of provable fraud.
• Privacy Forensics aims at deriving evidence on isolation
by the most probable data processing including its depen-
dencies and its classification to an anomaly pattern. A data
provenance scheme could derive such evidence. However,
since internal dependencies of an external ICT system are
usually not known, supervised machine learning in com-
bination with labeled evidence could be useful for deriv-
ing the probabilities of possible information exchange.
Since not all kind of data can be annotated, mechanisms
of unsupervised machine learning should also be
researched according to their suitability.
• IT Risk Analysis aims at evaluating and combining both
types of evidence to result in a qualitative (or quantitative)
statement on isolation, on information exchanges and, thus,
on security and privacy in the corresponding business net-
working application. This component should consider re-
sults from, e.g., the Big Data analytics and information
exchange on incidents. Based on the results of the risk
analysis, an information exchange can be balanced, i.e. the
corresponding security policies and compromises can be
decided according to all the participants’ risk preferences.
• System Evolution aims at automatic improvement of the
security configuration for an isolation and replacement of
compromised ICT systems or participants, respectively. A

removal of systems implies revocation of rights, which can
be, e.g. realized by revocation mechanisms for credentials.
In the case of accessed data, information has to be removed
along the subsequent data trace or at least made useless.
Data provenance and data mining technologies can support
auditing whether this information has indeed been removed.
We do not wish to claim that these five components are the
silver bullet to achieving ICT Resilience, however, we expect
that they can provide an initial categorization for topics that
address security and privacy in future business networking.
Summarizing, an ICT system providing a signaling-and-
screening architecture of ICT Resilience is by itself a business
networking application in providing ‘security-as-a-service’
with all its dependencies, vulnerabilities, and possibilities to
violate the privacy interests of data providers. Since security
and privacy cannot be guaranteed by technology alone, other
means should foster the participation of individuals and cor-
rectness of their data and services. Data protection acts com-
bined with adequate incentives are one option, however, they
require reliable methods and tools for signaling and screening
of actual behavior of all participants without harming their
privacy and security interests. We see the challenges as inter-
esting areas for research and finding solutions as a prerequisite
for exploiting the potential of business networking applica-
tions relying on extensive data processing.
Papers within ICT Resilience
All papers of this special issue contribute to one of the pre-
sented components of ICT Resilience. Dehling and Sunyaev
(‘Secure provision of Patient-Centered Health Information
Technology Services in Public Networks—Leveraging
Security and Privacy Features Provided by the German
Nationwide Health Information Technology Infrastructure’)
address the component Usage Control Policy Toolbox. They
investigate security and privacy in business networking using
the example of patient-centered health ICT services (PHS)
based on the German infrastructure gematik. They identify
security and privacy requirements of PHS, which could serve
as a starting point for specifying isolation patterns for an
information exchange of patients’ health data between medi-
cal service providers and third parties.
Gogoulos, Antonakopoulou, Lioudakis, Mousas,
Kaklamani, and Venieris (‘On the design of a privacy aware
authorization engine for collaborative environment’) also ad-
dress the component Usage Control Policy Toolbox with a
proposal for enforcing isolation of cross-organization informa-
tion exchanges. Their authorization engine derives
Security and privacy in business networking
authorizations for data processing from a semantic model in
accordance with the privacy and security interests of the
participants.
Kieseberg, Schrittwieser, Mulazzani, Echizen, and Weippl
(`An algorithm for collusion-resistant anonymization and fin-
gerprinting of sensitive microdata&apos;) refer to Privacy Forensics
in case of the disclosure of anonymized information to third
parties. They present a k-anonymization scheme, which tags
anonymized information by the procedure of their
anonymization. Their evaluation considers colluding data
consumers with the aim of non-authorized re-identification
of the related identity to this information.
Rechert, von Suchodoletz, and Valizada (`Take Care of
Your Belongings Today-Securing Accessibility to
Complex Electronic Business Processes&apos;) address accessibil-
ity of information for the purpose of keeping business pro-
cesses resilient. Since the outcome and costs of reconstructing
archived information with the configuration of the corre-
sponding instance of a business process are difficult to esti-
mate, their proposal is to emulate their reconstruction in
possible future data processing environments using software.
The aim is to identify clearly defined and controllable preser-
vation strategies, which should be integrated in current busi-
ness processes. This forecasting and emulation approach is
one option for supporting the continuous learning of isolation
and anti-isolation patterns for IT Risk Analysis.
We thank all authors for their valuable submissions, re-

<abstract confidence="0.975721826086956">Business networking relies on application-specific quantity and quality of information in order to support social infrastructures in, e.g., energy allocation coordinated by smart grids, healthcare services with electronic health records, traffic management with personal sensors, RFID in retail and logisor integration of network information into good, services, and rescue operations. Due to the increasing reliance of networking applications on sharing ICT services, dependencies threaten privacy, security, and reliability of information and, thus, innovative business applications in smart societies. Resilience is becoming a new security approach, since it takes dependencies into account and aims at achieving equilibriums in case of opposite requirements. This special issue on &apos;Security and Privacy in Business Networking&apos; contributes to the journal &apos;Electronic Markets&apos; by introducing a different view on achieving acceptable secure business networking applications in spite of threats due to covert channels. This view is on adapting resilience to enforcement of IT security in business networking applications. Our analysis shows that privacy is an evidence to measure and improve trustworthy relationships and reliable interactions between participants of business processes and their IT systems.

Business networking . Resilience. Information . Security. Privacy. Enforcement Business networking and resilience At present, one of the most promising visions for business networking is the exploitation of information with information and communication technology (ICT), in particular by Big Data analytics with cyber-physical systems (CPS) (acatech 2011;Wahlster and Müller2013).IBM calls it Corporation2008),the European Commission (2010)has started the corresponding program Digital Agenda for and Japan proposes the to be the Most Advanced IT Minister of Japan and His Cabinet2013).One aim of these initiatives is that systems, such as business networking applications, social infrastructures, and a society become resilient. Changes and vulnerabilities should be identified and analyzed to foresee and prevent incidents of any kind, as well as to react accordingly in acceptable time. Resilient ICT then supports the increased, sustainable welfare of a society. The key approach for gaining information on vulnerabilities and predicting incidents will be the ability to access and to analyze huge amounts of data in nearly real-time and to implement so-called Big Data analytics successfully. Service providers will collect, aggregate, and analyze data from various sources provided by CPS, e.g., business networks, social S. Wohlgemuth et al. networks, sensors and actuators, as well as governments and citizens. Prominent examples for such innovative business networking applications can be found, e.g., in the domain of energy allocation coordinated by smart grids, healthcare services with electronic records, traffic management with personal sensors and interconnected vehicles, RFID in retail and logistics, individualized manufacturing of goods, as well as services based on an social network. Such business networking applications share the Internet and its ICT services for global communication. Due to the increasing interdependence of the participating components, incidents may result in highly disruptive impacts. Technical failure, human error, accidents, or cyber-attacks might spread via dependencies and could threaten security and reliability of ICT services, the supported social infrastructures, and, in the end, the welfare and safety of our society. In order to improve the security and reliability of ICT support in this context, several approaches are currently being discussed and implemented. For example, the reform of the EU legal framework for electronic communications added Article 13a addressing security and reliability. It asks public and private service providers to take security measures and provide an incident report flow as an information exchange on vulnerabilities and incidents between providers, national regulatory authorities, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), and the European Commission. It is proposed that a qualified independent body should audit this information flow. The vision is that such an information exchange of incident reports would safeguard competition boost consumer choice (European Commission2009). For improving resilience, a spontaneous exchange of information of acceptable quantity and quality lies at the core of these approaches. While such extensive information exchange and analysis can already be observed in business networking (Riemer et al.2009)in the context of security and reliability it is still in an early stage. However, it would enable service providers to derive information on vulnerabilities and incidents by means of a secondary use of data with machine learning algorithms. In turn such information can be disclosed to other participants, e.g. actuators, who decide and act on this information to improve the security of their services and ICT. On the whole, such service providers and their business networking applications might be of high relevance for improving resilience of critical infrastructures, the emerging CPS, and future business networks. However, information exchange is also the basis for debetween ICT only in the desired way as realized in business networking applications, but also by creating undesirable vulnerabilities and risks. Unfortunately, not all dependencies of an ICT system can be detected (Wang and Ju2006)and, thus, they threaten trustworthiness and participation in an information exchange. Therefore, one key issue to be resolved for exploiting the full potential of future business networking is enforcing the individual security and privacy interests of all participants to achieve an acceptable trustworthy information exchange. This implies controlling the usage of information. Information exchange and intermediaries In computer science trustworthy information exchange means a reduction of vulnerabilities in the participating ICT systems and their communication in order to reduce the effect of any (Avizienis et al.2004).It also means that participants can formalize a security policy describing their individual security interests and negotiate on an agreed-upon security policy reflecting a compromise or equilibrium respectively et al.1999).In such multilateral IT security models protection goals, like accountability and become an important part of a security. Enforcing accountability and unobservability can be technically achieved by encryption and authentication schemes supporting pseudonymity, e.g. by identity manage- (Chaum1985)or cryptographic key systems (Pfitzmann Hansen2010).These approaches depend on confidentiality and integrity of the private key, its accountability to the given identity, and on integrity and consistency of a public key exchange. Even though trusted runtime environments exist et al.2013),security of a cryptographic key exchange without a trusted third party (TTP) has not yet been (Freire et al.2013). Introducing a third party extends the direct communication model of an information exchange. In practice, the role of a third party acting as an intermediary for an information exchange is manifold. Intermediaries take care of the security and reliability of the communication and of current payments. Successful examples are SWIFT and international clearing (Bons et al.2012).Intermediaries also establish relationships between data providers and data consumers by deriving information based on data collected with their consent. Successful examples here are loyalty card programs in the field of customer relationship management (CRM) or social networks sites. Furthermore, intermediaries can contribute to the usability of an information exchange to enforce the parsecurity interests. Usability studies of tools, e.g. PGP (Whitten and Tygar1999),show that their user interfaces and security concepts are too technical and not intuitive with the result that, as observed in Germany, over 70 % are willing to delegate responsibility for their to a TTP (DIVSI2012). Altogether, intermediaries in the role of TTP can be expected to play an important role with respect to extensive information exchange. However, they also represent a new vulnerability. Since an intermediary is usually involved in several information exchanges with different participants, Security and privacy in business networking between the ICT system and those of the other participants arise during run-time. Hence, a TTP also can be the origin of a possible man-in-the-middle attack with serious consequences for the information exchange. According to Article 13a incident reports in 2013, third party failure has a high impact. Most of the observed incidents have their direct cause in system overload, power and software bugs (Dekker et al.2013).The IT security for Germany in 2011 (BSI2011)shows a trend from direct attacks to indirect ones via dependencies to the affected ICT system. The report forecasts an increase in attacks by botnets, identity theft, security vulnerabilities, and malware. SCADA, mobile communications, interfaces and storage meor Cloud Computing systems of which are considto be part of future CPS an increased risk potential. A current study of Internet usage in Germany indicates that these threats represent a real hurdle for information exchange. A fear of misuse ofpersonal data is the main reason why the majority of the population in Germany refrains from in Internet services (DIVSI2012). Intermediaries can be expected to play a central role in future business networks in the context of providing privacy and security. However, they have to be trusted and, in other words, the less trust required, the better. Therefore, security and privacy mechanisms with a focus on intermediaries and their dependencies as origins of incidents are of interest for exploiting an effective information exchange in business networks. In respect of the realization of an incident report flow, there is no incentive to provide vulnerability information or to report incidents without adequate protection of the disclosed information. For example, a participant reporting a breach of confidentiality would be harmed twice: firstly by the incident itself and secondly by a loss of reputation due to the leakage of the confidential report. Security models and their enforcement The security approach to protect information once it has been disclosed to a third party is isolation on the part of the third party. Isolation means that exchanged information should not come into contact with other information exchanges and that the intermediary should not know what information is used in the service or the purpose for which the service is being used its consumers (Sonehara et al.2011).Thus, enforcement of isolation means to implement a multilateral trust model to enforce an equilibrium concerning the individual security interests of the participants. Individual security interests can be enforced by different security models as described in the following. At first, access control models formalize isolation by information flow control for a closed group of participants. Mandatory access control (MAC) security models, e.g. Biba, Bell-LaPadula, or the Chinese Wall Security Policy, are in widespread use and de Capitani di Vimercati2001).They model information flow control to protect data by the use of labels and a pre-defined order. The pre-defined order classifies data and identity of authorized participants as subjects into access classes and formalizes the properties on data access as provisions according to the protection goals of confidentiality or integrity, respectively. However, the protection goal availability of information might not be achieved easily if a MAC policy is deployed for a spontaneous information exchange: the pre-defined order of the security policy would have to be implemented for service providers, leading to confidentiality of the data but also to a restriction of the availability of the services. Hence, a security configuration based on MAC may lead to an incident on availability of information. Discretionary access control (DAC) where authorizations are granted to the identity of authorized service providers (data consumers) and not according to a security class, is more flexible. However, to date, DAC approaches are not precise enough for a trustworthy spontaneous information exchange. Granting access to data for given exchanges needs to define a group or role for the participants. This, in turn, could grant access to parties of an information exchange who are not participating in it representing a vulnerability regarding confidentiality and integrity of the information exchange. In contrast, the concept of distributed usage control specifies the confidentiality and integrity of an information exchange and, thus, information flows as data processing by obligations without restricting availability of information (Pretschner et al. 2006).The classification of Hilty et al.(2005)for obligations according to time and distribution shows that obligations are in general not enforceable but can become so at runtime. Concluding, an instance of a security model for a given isolation formalizes access on data and information, which is mapped to the identities of authorized subjects. According to the security model, security and privacy would be achieved if only authorized identities get access to the information as specified by provisions and obligations of the corresponding security policy and if these identities did in fact represent the corresponding data consumers. Their enforcement is to prevent incidents and to close vulnerabilities. A further relevant issue for realizing a trustworthy information exchange is the authenticity of the exchanged information. Authenticity of derived information is always subject to a given error probability. Firstly, this is conceptually due to application-dependent statistical model of machine learning (Domingos2012).Secondly, information relates to a given model, i.e. to a given context, e.g., described by service level agreements and security policies specifying the context of a data processing. At present, two opposing security concepts for enforcing isolation are under discussion: transparency and control. of data processing as stated by S. Wohlgemuth et al. et al.2008)follows the concept that data processing should be observed and evaluated with Technology (TET). aims at identifying an incident and its cause in order to decide on the accountability and trustworthiness of the affected partici- In contrast, control on data processing as with by Commission2010)considers the possibility of a violation of an isolation and aims at enforcing Technology (PET) achieves at least unobservability by pseudonymity. For selfprotection further PETs follow the approach of additionally impeding secondary use of information and re-identification of participants for purposes of data processing, which occur after data collection. This may raise additional incidents and, thus, requires transparency in their cause and origin to decide on trustworthiness of the participants. TET and dependencies TET aims at enforcing obligations for isolation by observing the current data processing and its compliance to a given security policy. If a policy violation occurs, an anomaly and its cause are analyzed to decide on accountability. It can establish whether the received information has been processed according to the corresponding security policy. A monitor observes data processing of an ICT system and logs it for a protection audit (Karjoth et al.2002).If enforcement of isolation of previous information exchanges and vulnerabilities of the ICT system of the data consumer are known, a data provider then can derive information about expected enforcement of isolation. Data leakage prevention aims at confidentiality of data processing. However, a monitor cannot consider more than one trace and is vulnerable to covert channels as seen by in Cloud Computing (Ristenpart et al.2009). This is an example of the vulnerability of data confidentiality via a dependency even though the service provider grants access to his services to authorized identities only. If confidentiality is not the highest priority for an information exchange but rather integrity, consensus protocols are an approach to tolerate incidents while resulting in a consensus of authentic information. Preferably different implementations of the same information exchange run in parallel. Consensus protocols assume an information exchange also between these implementations, e.g. by an unknown, inevitable dependency. However, it is impossible for consensus protocols to result in a consensus in the asynchronous timing model, if only one of the participating systems fails during the protocol run (Fischer al.1985).Adding extensions such as randomization, failure detectors, or strong primitives for shared-memory lead to consensus protocols coping with failed systems due to delayed or failed data transfer but not for malicious incidents. This is the case with timing restricting consensus protocols (Gärtner 1999).Consensus protocols for a synchronous model cope with failed systems up to a certain number of compromised ICT systems, even if they send different messages to other (Pfitzmann and Waidner1992).However, they restrict availability of the participating ICT systems. This is a vulnerability for any other information exchange with a dependency on this ICT system and out of the scope of the threat model of consensus protocols. Latest research approaches aim at retaining detected anomalies by evidence on the current model of data processing. That means they reconstruct the current model but without restricting availability. Secure logging and evidence (Sackmann et al. 2006)consider transparent data processing of separated ICT systems and restrict access to logged data to authorized identionly. Process mining (Van der Aalst2012)extends monitoring of the activities of an information exchange between ICT systems. The assumptions are completeness and authenticity of logged events, whereas confidentiality of the logged data in accordance to granting access on these observations to authoidentities is assured (Accorsi2011).Avariation ofprocess mining is data provenance, which also documents the history of and additionally their value by to the data and information (Buneman et al.2001).Schemes are inversion of data processing and annotation of data. Inversion depends on knowledge of the granted access decisions and the output data. This relates to the same completeness assumption as for secure logging and process mining. Annotation labels data so that the model of data processing can be re-constructed if a mapping to the data exists. However, current means for data provenance by annotation either assume centralized monitoring of the complete information exchange or are suitable for some kind of data without the derived information. Furthermore, data provenance can detect an information leakage and its cause only if the leaked information has been found together with on its history (Wohlgemuth et al.2010). Data provenance and secure logging as a components for each ICT system under investigation can in principle be used to check the integrity and origin of information by the reconstructed model and its comparison to the security policy. This reconstructed model in turn should extend the model of the applied machine learning scheme. In order to detect an identity theft, it may not be sufficient to reconstruct the model of this data processing, since it ends at the identity. It may also be necessary to check whether an anomaly in the usage of this identity exists regarding the information exchange under investigation. PET and dependencies After converting obligations into provisions, PET enforces them while considering violations of confidentiality of isolation. The assumption is an idealized threat model assuming ICT systems as being correct whereas trustworthiness of participants is uncertain. PET impedes re-identification, Security and privacy in business networking secondary use, and non-authorized profiling according to the master identity of a participating party. It can be achieved by restricting availability of information or the information itself et al.2009).This, in turn, threatens Big Data analytics with an increase of its error probability by introducing faulty information or the non-availability of sufficient quantity, whereas this does not depend on the type of machine learning (Biggio et al.2012;Huang et al.2011). Encryption protects information before access has taken place. However, after decryption, protection is no longer provided and information can be leaked via an unknown dependency. Identity management with anonymized credentials achieves accountability and unobservability as long as further disclosure to third parties is not considered and Lysanskaya2001).A non-linkable delegation of rights achieves unobservability and accountability in an information exchange with an intermediary under the assumption that the modeled recipient of the information as the last data consumer in its exchange is trustworthy and its ICT has no vulnerability (Wohlgemuth and Müller2006). However, this is not realistic for a spontaneous information exchange with an intermediary. Our analysis of dependencies in a spontaneous information and mechanisms to enforce its security model in accordance with the security and privacy interests of the participants shows that an incident and its propagation to a secure ICT system is always possible. On one hand, it is possible that an attacker can control the identity of this participant. On the other hand, strengthening transparency by consensus protocols or confidentiality by PET with reducing the information raises an incident on dependent information exchanges. encryption schemes (Dolev and Yao1983) enforce confidentiality and integrity of information and, at the same time, preserve its availability. Their general suitability is uncertain due to their required computing performance of the cryptographic scheme and a mismatch in abstraction of the (Naehrig et al.2011). Resilience as an approach for IT security and privacy At present security and privacy in business networking is based on a system and threat model, which includes a limited set of possible information exchanges and incidents. It considers expected states and dependencies including those, which have already passed. A partial model can be achieved for any subsystem, which does not change for an adequate time. However, this is not reality for many actual business networking applications which are highly dynamic and agile. Since vulnerabilities from dependencies arise during run-time and cannot be known and predicted, the approach is not adequate for preventing and reacting in this context. It is not (at least not efficiently) possible to model all changes and incidents and, thus, security with model-based approaches will have to follow changes in business networks and their underlying technology. security and privacy approaches to the dynamic and unforeseeable context of actual business networking means having to address these vulnerabilities and dependencies. The general view then changes from to preserving an acceptable level of service of a system that corresponds to a compromise of the individual security and privacy interests of the participants in an information exchange. Preserving an acceptable level of service of a system requires constantly adapting its dependencies to (Holling2001),a concept that is also known as resilience. However, a general statement on the resilience of a system cannot be made. It corresponds to a certain incident and the ability of a system to recover within a certain time for and composite costs and risks (Haimes2009).Since neither individual security and privacy interests (and compromises) nor vulnerabilities remain identical over time, an adaption of security and privacy enforcement is required. Thus, it is worth thinking about improving security and privacy in business networking by using methods and tools that support resilience of social infrastructures, i.e. in particular Big Data analytics and information exchange on incidents. For data providers and data consumers approaches are required that allow both to balance the benefit and the level of service, respectively, the security or privacy risk associated with information exchange. This means that, e.g., a data provider should be able to check before an information exchange takes place whether a data consumer might violate obligations for the information exchange. Vice versa, a data consumer should be able to check a priori of an information exchange whether the received information is the expected one and the data provider has followed the agreed-upon security policy for this information exchange. From an economic theory point of view, this leads to an asymmetric information situation that can usually be solved (or at least improved) by signalling or screening mechanisms (Furubotn Richter2005).Thus, new technical approaches that address the reduction of information asymmetry are being discussed as suitable methods and tools for improving security and privacy in business networking. Resilience signaling and screening architecture To empower data providers and data consumers to assess and balance the benefit and risk of entering an information exchange, classical security methods and tools should be complemented by methods and tools that support their decision making. To reduce information asymmetry, signalling components should give a participant a tool to generate evidence on his actual data usage to prove trustworthiness according to the corresponding obligations, as well as establish a reputation over S. Wohlgemuth et al. several information exchanges. In turn, a screening component should give a participant a tool to prove that exchanged information has been used as intended (or not). These tools are to be combined with accountability and an (economic) incentive system that allows each participant to evaluate the value of an information exchange according to the security configuration, the achievable level of, e.g. unobservability or accountability, and individual risk preferences. In accordance with our analysis and adapting current approaches for resilience to security and privacy in business networking, we use the following five components to categomethods and tools, as well as open research issues for A Control Policy Tool Box at formalizing isolation patterns for expected information exchanges and anti-isolation patterns for classes of anomalies of an isolation. On one hand, this is required for expressing the interest of the parties involved in an information exchange. On the other hand, this is a basis for detecting anomalies, incidents, and policy violations, as well as for generating correct incident reports and their exchange. The set of patterns should be extensible to cater for newly detected patterns during runtime and for previously unknown interferences and results. Privacy Control at self-protecting against information leakage. The real identities of data providers should remain unobservable when information is going to be disclosed to third parties. This requires, e.g., identity management supporting pseudonymity and non-linkable delegation of rights. Pseudonymity should be revocable in case of provable fraud. Privacy Forensics at deriving evidence on isolation by the most probable data processing including its dependencies and its classification to an anomaly pattern. A data provenance scheme could derive such evidence. However, since internal dependencies of an external ICT system are usually not known, supervised machine learning in combination with labeled evidence could be useful for deriving the probabilities of possible information exchange. Since not all kind of data can be annotated, mechanisms of unsupervised machine learning should also be researched according to their suitability. IT Risk Analysis at evaluating and combining both types of evidence to result in a qualitative (or quantitative) statement on isolation, on information exchanges and, thus, on security and privacy in the corresponding business networking application. This component should consider results from, e.g., the Big Data analytics and information exchange on incidents. Based on the results of the risk analysis, an information exchange can be balanced, i.e. the corresponding security policies and compromises can be according to all the preferences. System Evolution at automatic improvement of the security configuration for an isolation and replacement of compromised ICT systems or participants, respectively. A removal of systems implies revocation of rights, which can be, e.g. realized by revocation mechanisms for credentials. In the case of accessed data, information has to be removed along the subsequent data trace or at least made useless. Data provenance and data mining technologies can support auditing whether this information has indeed been removed. We do not wish to claim that these five components are the bullet to achieving however, we expect that they can provide an initial categorization for topics that address security and privacy in future business networking. Summarizing, an ICT system providing a signaling-andarchitecture of Resilience by itself a business application in providing with all its dependencies, vulnerabilities, and possibilities to violate the privacy interests of data providers. Since security and privacy cannot be guaranteed by technology alone, other means should foster the participation of individuals and correctness of their data and services. Data protection acts combined with adequate incentives are one option, however, they require reliable methods and tools for signaling and screening of actual behavior of all participants without harming their privacy and security interests. We see the challenges as interesting areas for research and finding solutions as a prerequisite for exploiting the potential of business networking applications relying on extensive data processing.
