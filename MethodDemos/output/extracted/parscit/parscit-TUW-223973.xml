Abstract. Translating clinical practice guidelines into a computer-inter-
pretable format is a challenging and laborious task. In this project we
focus on supporting the early steps of the modeling process by automati-
cally identifying conditional activities in guideline documents in order to
model them automatically in further consequence. Therefore, we devel-
oped a rule-based, heuristic method that combines domain-independent
information extraction rules and semantic pattern rules. The classifi-
cation also uses a weighting coefficient to verify the relevance of the
sentence in the context of other information aspects, such as effects, in-
tentions, etc. Our evaluation results show that even with a small set of
training data, we achieved a recall of 75 % and a precision of 88 %. This
outcome shows that this method supports the modeling task and eases
the translation of CPGs into a semi-formal model.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970910078947368">
Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are defined as “systematically developed
statements to assist practitioners and patient decisions about appropriate health-
care for specific circumstances” [6]. They include recommendations describing
appropriate care for the management of patients with a specific clinical condi-
tion. An important part of CPG contents refers to the procedures to perform,
often formulated together with specific conditions that have to hold in order to
execute an activity.
CPGs are published as textual guidelines, but in order to deploy them in some
kind of computerized tool (e.g., a reminder system or a more complex decision-
support system) they have to be represented in specialized languages (see [15, 7]
for a comparison and overview). Although different authoring/editing tools are
often associated with these languages, authoring is a labor-intensive task that
requires comprehensive knowledge in medical as well as computer science.
There have been several approaches to ease the modeling process, amongst
others by introducing intermediate representations that provide more semi-struc-
tured and less formal formats. One of them is MHB, the Many-Headed Bridge
2
[21], that tries to bridge the gap between the guideline text and its corresponding
formalized model. It falls in the category of document-centric approaches [22]
and is devised to produce a non-executable XML document with the relevant
CPG fragments, starting from the original text. The knowledge of a CPG is
thereby represented in a series of chunks that correspond to a certain bit of
information in the CPG (e.g., a sentence, part of a sentence, more than one
sentence). The information in a chunk is structured in various dimensions, e.g.,
control flow, data flow. To additionally support the modeling task for non-IT
experts, MHB was further developed and split into MHB-F (free-text version)
and MHB-S (semantically enriched version) [19]. MHB-F now provides a very
simplified structure to make the modeling even for non-IT experts feasible and
to leave modeling details to knowledge engineers in a later step.
In order to ease the laborious modeling, parts of the task should be automated
by applying information extraction methods. In this work we will focus on the
identification of condition-action sentences that form a prominent aspect of the
process flow in CPGs. The discovery of such combinations is not a trivial one.
On the one hand, condition-action sentences are rarely of the form ‘if condition
then action’, but require more sophisticated identification methods. On the other
hand, conditions may refer to effects, intentions, or events and not activities, and
these combinations have to be sorted out by our method. Table 1 shows a few
example sentences in regard to their MHB-F aspects.

In order to identify condition-action sentences we propose a rule-based method

sentence is relevant for modeling.

2 Background and Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999918866666667">
Guideline developers edit CPGs in a free-text format. In order to transform the
medical knowledge described in a guideline into execution models a translation
process is required. Moser and Miksch [14] detected prototypical patterns in free-
text guidelines to bridge this gap. Serban et al. [18] proposed an ontology-driven
extraction of linguistic patterns to pre-process a CPG in order to retrieve control
knowledge. The evaluation showed that the modeling as well as the authoring
process of guidelines was supported. Language engineering methods were used
in SeReMed [5] to detect diagnoses or procedures in medical documents. The
method was successfully applied to X-ray reports. These documents however,
show a standardized structure and therefore are easier to handle by knowledge
engineering methods than CPGs. Taboada et al. [23] identified relationships be-
tween diagnoses and therapy entities in free-text documents by matching the
core information units of a sentence with a collection of predefined relationships
but the quality of this matching was not rated. To implement a rule based ap-
proach to recognize medical entities the MeTAE (Medical Texts Annotation and
Exploration) platform was used by Abacha and Zweigenbaum [1]. Additionally,
semantic relations between each pair of these entities were identified by means
of MetaMap [2]. Consequently, relations between a problem (e.g., disease) and a
corresponding treatment were found. The method was applied to selected arti-
cles and abstracts of PubMed but not to CPGs. In [8] a heuristic-based approach
using information extraction methods independent of the final guideline repre-
sentation language was defined. This method was implemented and applied to
several guidelines containing a high amount of semi-structured text. The adop-
tion of this methodology on ’living-guidelines’ [9] showed promising results. A
set of semantic patterns representing activities based on semantic relations was
generated by Kaiser et al. [10] to identify medical activities in CPGs. Its effec-
tiveness was proved by a study which showed that a large part of control flow
related aspects could be identified. The relation between the activity and a cor-
responding condition, however, was not part of the method but is an important
requirement for the future automatic translation of a guideline.

<bodyText confidence="0.9987526">
Condition-based medical activities are expressed in clinical practice guidelines
in various ways and mostly found in single sentences. These sentences affect the
clinical pathway and therefore are relevant to the computer-interpretable model
of the guideline. In order to classify such a sentence as relevant, we based our
approach on the following hypothesis:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9320475">
1. A sentence owns a certain domain independent linguistic structure, and
2. contains recurrent domain dependent semantic key patterns.

We propose a rule-based, heuristic method using linguistic and semantic pat-
terns to classify sentences in CPGs as relevant for describing conditional activ-
ities in order to move towards an automatic translation of such sentences into
MHB in a following future step (an example is shown in Figure 1). Therefore,
we analyzed a CPG document to develop a general linguistic pattern set and a
semantic pattern set based on UMLS Semantic Types. These pattern sets then
form the basis for the subsequent classification by calculating the relevance rate
(rr).

For the development of the general linguistic pattern set we used a chapter from
an Asthma guideline developed by SIGN [17], where chapter 4: pharmacological
management had been modeled in the semi-structured modeling language MHB-
F [21] by a guideline modeling expert. We analyzed this chapter with regard to
the control flow aspects and started generating an initial linguistic pattern set
based on trigger words (12 occurrences for ’if’ and 4 occurrences for ’should’).

In order to identify the semantic clauses of a sentence (these are the parts de-
scribing the condition and the consequence), the patterns had to be grouped into
6 different patterns for ’if’ and 4 different patterns for ’should’ (some straightfor-
ward patterns are listed in Table 2). Condition and consequence are distinguished
according to the sentence’s syntax, punctuation and its sequence of phrases. Two
complex examples including conditions spread over multiple phrases are shown
in Figure 2.
We assigned a weighting factor to every pattern of the set - the value 0.5
to show that only a trigger word was found and 1.0 to express that also the
semantic clauses were identified. These constants can be adapted for new rule
types in the future.

Amongst the general syntactic patterns we also used semantic patterns based on

the GATE framework to automatically identify medical concepts in our text
and assign them to their corresponding UMLS concepts and semantic types

3.4 Calculation of the Relevance Rate
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988478375">
The relevance rate rr is a measure to find out whether a sentence contains a
condition-action combination. Furthermore, it shall classify a sentence as crucial
for the clinical pathway in contrast to other information aspects like intentions
or explanations which are modeled in MHB-F in a different way. To find this se-
mantic difference the syntax of the sentences as well as their containing medical
semantic types must be respected. In order to calculate the relevance rate for
a selected sentence its semantic abstraction has to be generated and compared
with every entry in the semantic pattern pool. If the rule type and the semantic
clause type are matching, the similarity of the sequences of the semantic types
is calculated by using the Dice coefficient [12]. The highest value is selected for
further calculation.
In general, the value of the relevance rate rr is the sum of
– the weight(w) of the applied general IE rule, and
– the sum of the maximum similarity value (si) for each semantic clause of
the sentence divided by the number of semantic clauses (n) identified by the
general IE rules.

�n i=1 max{si} (1)
rr = w +
n
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.987363941176471">
The weight of the IE rule and the arithmetic average of the similarity values -
both in the range between 0 and 1 - have the same influence on the rr.
The similarity value si of the semantic clause of a sentence and a matching
entry in the semantic pattern pool were calculated as follows:
– If the semantic clause contains only one semantic type it is compared to
those entries of the semantic pattern pool that also show only one semantic
type (to receive a better accuracy). In the case that both types are equal the
value for si is set to 1.0, otherwise
– both sequences of semantic types are interpreted as a string each and two
sets of 4-letter string bigrams are composed out of them. Subsequently, these
two sets are used for the calculation of the Dice coefficient.

Example:
Given are the sequence of semantic types of a new semantic clause S and the
sequence of semantic types of a matching entry of the semantic pattern pool P.
S: [fndg] [orgf] [qlco] [gngm] [phsu] and P: [strd] [gngm] [phsu] [ortf].

Generally, the results proved that the rules of type “if” showed much bet-
ter results for the precision (93%) and the recall (82%) than the ones of type
“should”. Nevertheless, the negative predictive value for the latter type showed
a rate of 93%.
The analyzed guidelines contained 7 sentences with control flow related in-
formation but they were not classified because their patterns did not exist in the
Asthma guideline. Consequently, no corresponding general linguistic IE rule ex-
isted in the pattern pool. An extension of the general linguistic pattern set with
rules for the trigger words “when”, “could” and “in case of” should be taken
into consideration. Additionally, 1 condition based activity could not be found,
because the semantic information was distributed over more than one sentence.
In Table 7 selected examples are shown with a relevance rate lower or equal than
1.0 together with the corresponding reasons.
Even though only a small amount of training data (16 sentences) was avail-
able from the Asthma guideline, our method identified condition-based activities
for control flow related aspects in a guideline document. Furthermore, it showed
that the combination of domain independent information extraction rules and
an automatically created semantic pattern pool leads to valuable results.

5 Conclusions and Further Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941888888889">
The aim of this paper was to develop a method to identify condition-action sen-
tences. By defining a set of linguistic patterns we split up sentences semantically
- from one selected training guideline - into their clauses showing the condition
and the consequence. We used the UMLS Semantic Network [13] to find out
which types of medical concepts were applied in these clauses. The outcome was
a semantic abstraction of every training sentence which then was stored in a
semantic pattern pool. This pool facilitated the classification of new sentences
regarding to their relevance to the corresponding MHB-F model expressed by
the measure relevance rate (rr).

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.856289">
1. Condition-based activities in free-text guidelines, which must be modeled in
MHB-F, are identified and rated.
2. These sentences are automatically split into the condition and the resulting
activity.
An integration of the presented method into modeling tools will ease the work
of all parties involved.
Ongoing steps will be (1) the implementation of additional information ex-

<abstract confidence="0.983270733333333">clinical practice guidelines into a computer-interpretable format is a challenging and laborious task. In this project we focus on supporting the early steps of the modeling process by automatically identifying conditional activities in guideline documents in order to model them automatically in further consequence. Therefore, we developed a rule-based, heuristic method that combines domain-independent information extraction rules and semantic pattern rules. The classification also uses a weighting coefficient to verify the relevance of the sentence in the context of other information aspects, such as effects, intentions, etc. Our evaluation results show that even with a small set of training data, we achieved a recall of 75 % and a precision of 88 %. This outcome shows that this method supports the modeling task and eases the translation of CPGs into a semi-formal model. clinical guidelines; medical guideline formalization; Many-Headed Bridge (MHB); UMLS; Information</abstract>
