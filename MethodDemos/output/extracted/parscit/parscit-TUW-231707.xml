ABSTRACT: The VRVis Research Center in Vienna is the largest technology transfer
institution in the area of Visual Computing in Austria. The requirements of the funding body
FFG include the publication of scientific research results in first class peer reviewed media, and
the active cooperation with co-funding companies. As a consequence the requirements on the
staff of VRVis are manifold: they have to communicate with real users, use real data, know
about software and hardware, understand the market, do professional documentation, initiate
new projects and write funding proposals for these, be part of the scientific community and
publish and review papers, manage several projects in parallel and obey strict deadlines for their
projects and some more. Such staff is barely available and must be trained on the job.

1 INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998464">
Visual Computing helps for many applications, often it provides visual solutions to data
intensive problems. However, academic research often solves problems suspected by the
researchers, rather than problems that appear in industry. The VRVis Research Center is set up
to solve real problems from the real world, which is mostly less spectacular in the pure scientific
sense, but it leads to practically useable results. This sort of research is not less demanding,
however seen as second class research by many academics. For the researchers themselves it is
rather more difficult than academic research, because the goal cannot be changed to avoid
complications. In addition, VRVis researchers need to have numerous other &amp;quot;non academic
qualifications&amp;quot;.

2 THE VRVis RESEARCH CENTER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999828272727273">
The VRVis Competence Center (VRVis 2014) was founded in 2000 funded by the Austrian
Kplus program, and since 2010 it is funded by the Austrian COMET program as a K1 center. Its
mission is to perform research and development in Visual Computing and bridge the gap
between science and industry with translational research. VRVis is located in the TechGate
building in Vienna, Austria, and has an annual budget of around 5 million Euros from which
mainly around 65 researchers are paid.
The VRVis Research Center is set up as a non-profit-making limited company which is owned
by universities and many companies. Currently VRVis is organized in three areas, which are
Rendering, Visualization, and Visual Analytics. Each area performs some five to ten projects,
most of which are multi-firm projects, that means that more than one company contributes to its
budget.

3 THE UNDERSTANDING OF INNOVATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974">
In theory there is a common understanding how innovation happens. Scientists and researchers
investigate the unexplored world and produce publically accessible publications and patents.
This process is mostly done at universities and public research institutions. Then developers in
companies make use of these findings and results to produce solutions for the real world, stable
products for the world market. In large companies often additional research is added, the results
of which are mostly protected by patents immediately, or they are kept secret altogether.
In practice this innovation chain rarely happens that way. The research results from academics
have assumed ideal conditions, non-realistic constraints and flawless input data, so that an
additional step is necessary to adapt such results to realistic requirements. This step is larger
than many scientists are aware of, and it justifies specialized translational research institutions
such as VRVis, AIT, Fraunhofer, and others. In close cooperation with developers from
companies, these institutions have the competence to adapt pure research results to the
requirements of the real world, and the people working there need special skills to perform these
tasks.

4 REQUIREMENTS ON TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH STAFF
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999305">
In addition to the necessity to perform first class project work, i.e. to meet the defined project
goals, researchers at a translational research institution such as VRVis need to be able to cope
with a variety of additional challenges. These are partly due to the real life conditions, and
partly because the overall requirements exceed those of pure research.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.933806">
4.1 Communication with Real Users
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999556916666667">
Dealing with people from outside the field of computer science uncovers the use of different
languages for the same things, and the complexity of some aspects that seem simple for the
computer scientist. Often the user describes a problem and her/his envisaged solution in the
idealistic world of her/his realm. The project leader misunderstands parts, and adds new ideas
based on her/his knowledge of technical possibilities. The programmer interprets these
requirements based on her/his personal experience and attitudes and produces something the
user believes is wrong. Only during this last discussion it turns out that the first description by
the user was incomplete, the interpretation by the project leader went in the wrong direction and
the creativity of the programmer (and possible errors in the code) produced an unusable result.
Coping with this situation is a challenge in its own. In addition some users misunderstand the
options and possibilities, and also all users (and scientists, of course) are different characters,
that don’t always fit together.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.844307">
4.2 Use of Real Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9978018">
Idealized test data are always created optimally so that the foreseen variations of an algorithm
work fine. Data from the real world is erroneous, incomplete, inexact, includes many exceptions
to the defined rules, and, above all that, is often huge, much larger than the algorithm was
intended for. Especially the adaptation of functioning and published state-of-the-art algorithms
to extreme data sizes is a main research topic for VRVis researchers.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.509627">
4.3 Hardware and Market Knowledge
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972509">
Researchers operating under realistic conditions need to be experts with all the various hardware
they use. Many fast algorithms have to be implemented with hardware dependent components
to ensure low level optimization. Today not only the large amount of companies creates many
different interfaces, but also the immense variety of special hardware components. To make
optimal use of these, it is also necessary to keep an overview over new product developments,
hardware trends and announced products. Visiting technical exhibitions and fairs, reading
computer journals and watching announcements in electronic media are necessary and expected
activities.
4.4 Project Initiation and Proposal Writing
New projects don’t come by themselves. VRVis researchers are also experts in generating new
projects. They need to be aware of all funding opportunities and know how to write a successful
funding proposal. Based on intensive contacts with many companies they must also
communicate the functioning of a translational research institution to these. For the proposals
they need to be aware of the state-of-the-art of their science field and of the intended application
field. They have to be trained in project planning, including time and budget plans. And they
have to be experienced and consequent to collect the proposal parts the company partners have
to deliver in time!
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.93144">
4.5 Scientific Publishing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999825857142857">
Evaluators of any research institution are often pure academic researchers. Their main
evaluation criterion is then scientific output, i.e. the number and quality of produced scientific
publications. Therefore, VRVis researchers have to fully understand this aspect and be able to
write scientific publications that will be accepted at high quality media. This includes knowing
where to publish, knowing the scientific state-of-the-art, and giving good talks at conferences.
But it is also a challenge to get the o.k. from companies to publish at all, and to judge any con-
flicts such a publication might have with patents or other intellectual property rights involved.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.32799">
4.6. Professional Documentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970713588235294">
As opposed to usual scientific results which are produced for one time demonstration of the
correctness of a result, software or system components intended for practical use need to be
accompanied by understandable and complete documentation and user manuals. In addition,
companies involved in a project often require training sessions for the people who either will
use the results or who are involved in strategic decisions at the company. Thus it is necessary
that the programmers and project leader maintain the user view of their products – not always
easy when you are deep into the details.
4.7 Multi-tasking under Time Pressure
Projects for the real world also have real deadlines. University scientists are used to extendible
deadlines, flexible result progress, and no concrete consequences in case they miss these. Only
submission deadlines at conferences generate some stress, but again, no severe consequences
other than postponing the result to the next available publication option occur. In contrast, when
cooperating with companies there are project contracts, fixed deadlines and there is little
compromise accepted for the results. This increased time stress is accompanied by nervous
roommates, noise, telephone calls, emails, reviews, guests, continued education, project
initiations, and many more disturbing factors. It needs special concentration to be able to work
under such conditions.

5 CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999068">
Translational research is a challenge in its own, often underestimated by academic scientific
staff. Besides excellence in computer science involved researchers need to have various
valuable skills not taught in usual university courses. Thus the value of a research organization
depends even more on its well selected employees and the relevant skills learned on the job than
on any other aspect.
