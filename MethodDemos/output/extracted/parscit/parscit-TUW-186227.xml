Abstract — One indispensable precondition for designing a
functional software product for the modeling and execution of
a computerized clinical practice guideline (CPG) is the com-
prehensive investigation of the different user groups involved
and the issues they encounter. This led us to conduct a compre-
hensive literature study about the tasks involved in modeling
a CPG into a formal representation as well as about the in-
formation needs of caregivers, i.e., physicians and nurses, and
last but not least the information needs of patients. We have
assessed and categorized the above mentioned information in
order to create a reliable starting point for the development of
a functional software tool.

I. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940052631579">
CPGs [1] are powerful tools to improve the quality of
healthcare [2, 3]. In recent years different software sys-
tems have been developed to support the design and ex-
ecution of CPGs [4, 5]. However, from the creation
of a computer-executable model of a CPG to its ac-
tual implementation in clinical care a variety of tasks
emerge, such as translating the medical knowledge of
a textual CPG, i.e., recommendations, into a computer-
interpretable model, applying a recommended therapy on
a patient, or answering clinical questions.
Unfortunately, there is a lack of comprehensive infor-
mation on (1) the different user groups of a software tool
to support all of these tasks, (2) what tasks these users
want to perform, and (3) what information is required for
it. However, this information is mandatory to make valid
decisions on the design of such a software product [6].
In this paper we give a short outline of our results;
for a detailed representation of investigated studies and
derived findings we refer to [7].

II. INFORMATION NEEDS OF MODELERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999319535714285">
The main task of a guideline modeler is to create a for-
mal guideline representation model of the original narra-
tive guideline. There are two basic types of formaliza-
tion: a model-centric approach and a document-centric
approach.
In any case, the modeler needs to know of which com-
ponents the target representation format is composed
(e.g., actions, decisions, states, subplans, and branches)
and in which way scheduling constraints are to be mod-
eled. Moreover, the modeler needs to identify the rel-
evant guideline knowledge and to disambiguate this
knowledge.
For model-centric formalization the modeler formu-
lates a conceptual model of a guideline without a di-
rect relationship between the original text and the model.
This modeling process involves steps like generating de-
tailed data models of clinical concepts and fundamental
parameters, specifying a logical and process structure
of the CPG, and modeling the guideline knowledge by
means of a flowchart-like graph.
When modeling the guideline knowledge in an
document-centric way, the original text of the docu-
ment serves as a starting point which is systematically
marked up, whereupon the marked-up text parts are
structured into a – usually XML-based – model. This in-
cludes making knowledge elements independent from
the surrounding text, modeling clinical actions, and de-
termining temporal constraints.

III. CLINICAL INFORMATION NEEDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999146">
In addition, we have investigated user expectations and
requirements that have to be considered in creating a clin-
ically useful software environment. An outline of basic
categories of clinical information needs derived from di-
verse studies is given in Figure 1.

<bodyText confidence="0.98268334375">
As regards the information sought by physicians, a num-
ber of studies has been conducted, mainly in the form of
retrospective questionnaires, interviews, self-reports, and
observation.
According to these studies, the majority of questions
posed by physicians deals with therapy and especially
with all sorts of aspects associated with medication.
Physicians seems to have a great need for information
about the correct drug, its effectiveness, its side effects,
its dosage, and how long it should be taken. Diagnostic
questions also appear quite frequently as do questions
about patient data and questions about other health-
care providers. In contrast, questions concerning the
prognosis, the etiology of disease, etc. seem to be of
comparatively little concern, if we are to believe the find-
ings of the investigated studies.
B. NURSES AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS
When focusing on the information needs of nursing
staff, it is interesting to note that there is little differ-
ence between the questions posed by nurses and what
the physicians want to know. The only real difference
seems to result from their different relationships to pa-
tients: nurses are interested in psycho-social support of
patients whereas physicians have not formulated such
questions in the studies investigated in this paper.
The main difference between nurses and nurse practi-
tioners is that the latter are more concerned with diag-
nostic issues than nurses. In accordance with the results
for physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners need most
information about treatment and diagnosis, in which
they require information about institution specific pro-
cedures and medication quite frequently.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.701674" genericHeader="method">
C. PATIENTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993934928571429">
The information desired by patients is more voluminous
and differ qualitatively from either the questions formu-
lated by physicians or those formulated by nurses. Since
they are not only worried about illness itself but also
about the effects this illness has on family members,
precise information on circumstances they are likely to
expect when visiting other medical facilities, and, last
but not least, detailed information about available sup-
port, such as psycho-social support, is required.
In particular, patients require much more detailed in-
formation on emotional effects of their treatment and its
effects on their quality of life. As is to be expected,
prognosis and chances of recovery are also of major in-
terest for patients.
IV. CONCLUSION
By providing categorized information from several stud-
ies and publications, we establish an information basis
necessary for the design of a useful software tool facili-
tating the modeling process and the execution of a CPG.
Depending on the potential and purpose of the individ-
ual tool, it may not be necessary (nor always possible)
to include all of these tasks and information needs, but
the decision as to which points to include and which to
leave out can only be made on the basis of such an all-
comprising list. We recommend that developers carefully
consider every single aspect presented in [7], as all of
these aspects have been formulated as modeling tasks or
as actual information needs in clinical praxis.
