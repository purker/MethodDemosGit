Abstract—The purpose of the project VALCRI is to develop a
new system prototype for information exploitation by intelligence
analysts working in law enforcement agencies. Information visu-
alisation will be a core element of the prototype. Such systems
have to be designed to support the sensemaking and reasoning
processes of the analysts. One of the goals of the project is,
therefore, to get a more thorough understanding of sensemaking
processes and to develop a set of recommendations for the design
of intelligence analysis systems to help analysts in their work.

I. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989461538462">
One of the main tasks of modern intelligence analysts is
drawing defensible conclusions from available information.
This task can be made easier by presenting the material
in a way that supports human sensemaking and reasoning
processes. Visualisation can play an important role here, but
to achieve this goal it is necessary to understand human
cognitive processes in this context. The purpose of the project
VALCRI is to develop a new system prototype for information
exploitation by intelligence analysts working in law enforce-
ment agencies. One of the key problems is to ’connect the
dots’ or to quickly find the few pieces of relevant information
from very large datasets (such as systems containing big data)
and to piece them together so that it is possible to draw a
sensible, reasonable and justifiable conclusion. Much of this
process is presently very labour intensive and inefficient. When
completed, VALCRI will integrate advanced and powerful data
analytic software for automated extraction of meaningful in-
formation and related text, documents, images and videos, and
for detecting signatures or patterns across multi-dimensional
data that provide early warnings or triggers of impending
criminal or terrorist action. Part of the project will involve
the analysis of human reasoning processes and cognitive biases
which might hinder analysts from drawing correct conclusions.
The goal is to develop a set of guidelines and recommendations
to help the analysts in their work and to design visualisations
providing a comprehensive overview of the data.

II. SENSEMAKING AND COGNITIVE BIAS MITIGATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999565">
Theories of sensemaking and cognitive bias mitigation
are among the core foundations for this approach. From
this research, recommendations for designing systems for
intelligence analysis can be derived. Through a review of
120 case studies, Klein [1] found that ”Insights change our
understanding by shifting the central beliefs - the anchors -
in the story (narrative) we use to make sense of events ... ”
(p148). Klein further recommends that systems designed for
such use should ”make it easy for users to shift goals and
plans without getting disoriented.” (p148). In VALCRI we
propose investigating the validity of this proposition as a basis
to design systems that would support discovery and insight
generation by the easy and playful creation and assembly of
tentative narrative explanations that can fluidly evolve into
rigorous arguments. Further within VALCRI we propose that
the underlying theory of gaining insights is Klein’s data frame
model of sensemaking [2]. This model enables us to view
the process of human sensemaking in a very realistic rather
than normative manner. It also provides a base to model
confirmation bias which is believed to have an extremely
significant influence in intelligence analysis. Solutions should,
therefore, also aim to mitigate cognitive bias. Even though
there has been a lot of research on different cognitive biases
in the last few decades (e.g. [3]), no satisfying result has yet
been reached. The number of cognitive biases to be mitigated
is too large to get them under control with a simple strategy.
Thus, we aim to develop new and combine tried and tested
debiasing techniques to create software solutions that support
human decision and sensemaking processes by considering
various traps when drawing conclusions. The project has
the ambitious goal of developing a tool that is sophisticated
enough to meet the needs of criminal intelligence analysts
while handling general cognitive failures using visualisations
in big data will be met in the 4 years duration of the project
VALCRI. For that purpose international experts in the fields
of human cognition as well as visualisation and intelligence
analysis will collaborate closely to take the research on human
cognition to a new level.
