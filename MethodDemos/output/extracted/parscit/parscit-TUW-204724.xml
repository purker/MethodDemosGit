Abstract: The strategic management of intellectual capital in-
volves rethinking how the companies creates value from a know-
ledge-centric perspective and redesigning and orchestrating the
role of staff knowledge in the firm’s strategy. This paper presents
the author’s software system for facilitating decision making at a
strategic level in terms of the profitability of investment in staff
knowledge. This software is a computer implementation of the

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99997725">
The advantage of a company in the SME sector (small
and medium sizes enterprises) is determined by
effectiveness and the extent of the knowledge-workers&amp;apos;
involvement. The role of intellectual capital management
consists in striving to increase the share of immaterial
resources (at the costs of the material ones) in the
generated products, services, and the total market value
of an organization (Król and Ludwiczyński, 2007).
To manage of intellectual capital more systematically,
the firm must devise an agenda for transforming from an
organisation simply comprising knowledge able
individuals to a knowledge–focused organisation that
stewards the creation and sharing of knowledge within
and across internal business function and that
orchestrates the flow of know-how to and from external
firms.
Many studies have focused on knowledge manage-
ment strategies and methodologies from an organizational
perspective (Barthelme et al., 1998), (Basu, 1998), (Ca-
rayannis, 1998), (Drew, 1999). Many useful studies on
the development of information sharing systems and col-
laborative tools to support intra-organizational processes
and teamwork also exist (Chen and Liang, 1999).
However, both the methodology and software system
functionality for knowledge management are highly de-
pendent on the process characteristics and the knowledge
involved.
The competitive advantage of companies, especially
SMEs, decide to increasingly knowledge and innovation
potential. Knowledge is a broad concept, embracing both
the knowledge formalized (explicit) and non-formal
knowledge (hidden). Looking at the relationship between
data, information, management information and
knowledge (Senn, 1990) should be regarded knowledge
as a strategic resource company. Application of
information systems that support knowledge management
in SMEs can give guarantees a constant competitive
advantage in the market.
The article presents the description of strategic
knowledge resources in companies and author’s method
for plannig and selection of personnel in SME (see
chapter 2). In the third chapter the author’s software sys-
tem for facilitating decision making at a strategic level in
terms of the profitability of investment in staff knowledge
is presented on example of the decision-making situation
in which an innovative SME is considering the employ-
ment of a new m-th employee. The summary shows the
directions of further work.

While resources are important to the performance of a
firm, according to a resource-based view, whether or not
an organization gains a competitive advantage and any
associated returns, depends on the strategic planning
used to leverage those resources (Chrisman et al., 2003);
(McGrath and MacMillan, 2000).
The need to describe a strategic-knowledge resource
was motivated by the concept of resource management
(Sirmon and Hitt, 2003) as well as competence manage-
ment (Berio and Harzallah, 2005)- see Fig. 1:

So, the following personnel SME usefulness function Wnm
for the m-th employee in the SME is proposed:
Wnm = f1(GK) +f2(PK) +f3(A) +f4(E) + f5(P) + f6(C) + f7(R),
where: n, m∈ N,
The linear form of this function Wnm is chosen because
all elements are independent and equally important to
assess the effectiveness and efficiency of investment in
knowledge. It is possible to receive indispensable data for
account of value personnel usefulness function from com-
panies belonged to reference model of SMEs (Patalas-
Maliszewska, 2009) by interview in each enterprise. Each
employee should complete the questionnaire. On the
basis of an algorithm for testing solutions for each em-
ployee it is possible to receive a specific value of the per-
sonnel usefulness function and each of the parameters of
this function.
A four-element method for the planning and selection
of strategic knowledge resources in SME has been built.
The four elements are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997040375">
• A reference model of an SME-sector company,
• The value of the personnel usefulness function
for each m-th employee in SME
• The qualifying criteria in an innovative company,
• An algorithm which will enable the connection of
the value of strategic resources of knowledge to
the value of the qualifying criteria for an innova-
tive company - GMDH.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.995745928571429">
The method was created on the basis of methods for
the assessment of capital value and on the characteristics
of innovative companies. It combines available knowl-
edge gained from literature, and experiences of SMEs
which have the potential for innovation.
The method allows for making an assessment of the
future value of the decision about the selection of an em-
ployee in the relation to increasing innovation in a SME-
sector company.
The next chapter presents the author’s software sys-
tem for facilitating decision making at a strategic level in
terms of the profitability of investment in staff knowledge,
which considers all elements of the presented method.

The decision regarding the selection of an appropriate
employee requires the company management to assess
the efficiency of this investment. The application of the
model makes it possible to obtain a forecast of the value
of the strategic knowledge resources within a given or-

innovative SME is considering the employment of the m-th
employee, is presented in the diagram:

The decision-making situation of the SME sector has
been presented; this decides on the employment of new
employees in sales. Also the author has described the
example of the company A2, which is looking for an em-
ployee to the fill the position of ‘regional assistant’. The
company expects to retain its current level of innovation.
Stage 1:
Using the proposed system, it is possible to check to see
whether the company complies with the specified refer-
ence model. A potential new employee selects actions
that will be performed in the company. The developed
reference model will help companies to determine the
work place for a new employee.

Through the use of the tool known as the system to sup-

which is the implementation of the method for planning
and selection of personnel in SME, the following informa-

X7 - number of employees with scientific degrees,
X13 - the number of purchased and used licenses.
Stage 3:
For the new potential employee as a ‘Regional Assistant’,
by using the decision model we obtain the following fore-
cast of the personnel usefulness function, the company&amp;apos;s
request for the sample of A2’s values of characteristics of
innovation:

1,7486X132+3,8323X7X13, where
X7 - number of employees with scientific degrees,
X13 - the number of purchased and used licenses
Stage 4:
Using the the author’s software system, the actual value
of the personnel usefulness function for a new employee
is checked (see Fig. 6):

Stage 5:

<bodyText confidence="0.999755142857143">
Then we compare the actual value of the personnel use-
fulness function with the expected new employee. If these
values are similar, it is assumed that the employment of
the employee will allow us to maintain the current level of
innovation within the company.
The actual value of the function: Wm4= 19
The forecast value of the function:

<equation confidence="0.480823666666667">

for
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.973430875">
X7 - number of employees with scientific degrees – X7 = 2,
X13 - the number of purchased and used licenses - X13 = 1
The company can decide to recruit new employees for the
position of ‘Regional assistant’ because the predicted
value of the personnel usefulness function for the new
employee is in line with the actual value of the function,
which would allow the company to maintain a certain level
of innovation.

<bodyText confidence="0.999968785714286">
This paper presents the author’s system for supporting
decision making at the strategic level with regards to the
assessment of knowledge in an innovative SME. Through
the example of using this system, the author shows how
the forecasting of the values of strategic knowledge re-
sources (values of the personnel usefulness function for
the m-th employee) will be carried out. The current state
of advancement of research allows the application of this
system for SME sector in line adopted reference model
(the reference model of SME is strictly defined in the other
works of the author). The selection of employees using
the proposed system is characterized by objectivity, me-
thodical and uniformity, fairness and impartiality, profes-
sionalism.
