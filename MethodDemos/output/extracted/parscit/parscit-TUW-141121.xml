Abstract. Multimedia content can be described in versatile ways as
its essence is not limited to one view. For music data these multiple
views could be a song’s audio features as well as its lyrics. Both of these
modalities have their advantages as text may be easier to search in and
could cover more of the ‘content semantics’ of a song, while omitting
other types of semantic categorisation. (Psycho)acoustic feature sets, on
the other hand, provide the means to identify tracks that ‘sound simi-
lar’ while less supporting other kinds of semantic categorisation. Those
discerning characteristics of different feature sets meet users’ differing
information needs. We will explain the nature of text and audio feature
sets which describe the same audio tracks. Moreover, we will propose
the use of textual data on top of low level audio features for music genre
classification. Further, we will show the impact of different combinations
of audio features and textual features based on content words.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.998665928571429">
The large-scale adoption of new business models for digital audio material is hap-
pening already. What many content providers and online music vendors are still
missing are appropriate means of presenting their media to their users according
to different information needs. Amazone or last.fm2 have shown the potential of
recommendation engines based on the mining of transactional data.
It further is an intrinsic need for every Music Information Retrieval system
to include not only recommendation or playlist generation engines, but also pos-
sibilities for searching and browsing. Music Information Retrieval has made huge
progress in terms of devising sophisticated descriptors for the acoustic content
of music. Research in this direction facilitates numerous content-based search
scenarios, such as query by humming, or organisation tasks, such as genre classi-
fication, playlist generation, and browsing access by perceived sound similarity.
Song lyrics cover semantic information about a song’s contents on a level
that could never be covered by audio features only. Many users may rather

be interested in songs that cover similar topics than sound alike. Some musical
genres, such as e.g. Christmas candles, can only be detected by including textual
features, as they occur across many different musical genres and the definition
of the genre itself is rather done on a topic level.
We thus combine both textual as well as audio information for music genre
classification, i.e. automatically assigning musical genres to tracks based on audio
features as well as content words in song lyrics.
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a brief
overview of related work. This is followed by a description of our classification
experiments in Section 3, as well as outlook on current work in Section 4.

The area of Music Information Retrieval has been heavily researched, particu-
larly focusing on audio feature extraction. First experiments with content-based
Music Information Retrieval were reported in [1] as well as [6], the focus be-
ing on automatic genre classification of music. In this paper we use a modified
version of the Rhythm Patterns features, previously used within the SOMeJB
system [5]. Based on that feature set, [2] shows that the Statistical Spectrum
Descriptors yield relatively good results at a manageable dimensionality.
A sophisticated semantic and structural analysis including language identi-
fication of songs based on lyrics is conducted in [4]. Artist similarity based on
song lyrics is performed in [3], pointing out that similarity retrieval using lyrics
is inferior to acoustic similarity. It is also suggested that a combination of lyrics
and acoustic similarity could improve results, further motivating the research
reported in this paper.

3 Experiments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999875166666667">
Due to the lack of public benchmark corpora, we created a parallel corpus of
audio and song lyrics files of a music collection of 9.758 titles organised into
41 genres. Class sizes ranged from only a few songs for the ‘Classical’ genre to
about 1.900 songs for ‘Punk Rock’. In order to utilise the information contained
in music for genre classification, we describe sets of audio features derived from
the waveform of audio tracks as well as the bag-of-word features for song lyrics.

3.1 Audio Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998393142857143">
Three features were computed from audio tracks in standard PCM format with
44.1 kHz sampling frequency (e.g. decoded MP3 files). Rythm Patterns (RP) [5],
also called Fluctuation Patterns, denote a matrix representation of fluctuations
on critical bands (parts of it describe rhythm in the narrow sense), resulting in
a 1.440 dimensional feature space. Statistical Spectrum Descriptors (SSDs, 168
dimensions) are statistical moments derived from a psycho-acoustically trans-
formed spectrogram [2]. Rhythm Histograms (RH, 60 dimensions) are calculated

3.2 Lyrics Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996610636363636">
For every piece of music, three lyrics portals were accessed, using artist name
and track title as queries. If the results from lyrc.com.ar were of reasonable size,
these lyrics were assigned to the track. If lyrc.com.ar fails, sing365lyrics.com will
be checked for validity, then oldielyrics.com.
All lyrics were processed using the bag-of-words model and weighted by tfidf
information. Feature selection was done via document frequency thresholding,
i.e. the omittance of terms that occur in a very high or very low number of
documents. For the matrices used for the experiments terms occurring in more
than half of the documents were omitted, the lower threshold was then adjusted
to meet the desired dimensionality. Downscaling was performed to different di-
mensionalities matching the dimensionalities of the audio feature spaces.

3.3 Classification Results
</subsectionHeader>
<tableCaption confidence="0.697231">
Table 1 shows classification accuracies for a set of experiments based on audio
and lyrics features as well as combinations thereof. Experiments were performed
by Weka’s implementation of Support Vector Machines for ten-fold stratified
cross validation. Results shown are the macro averaged classification accuracies.
Results show that a combination of lyrics and audio features improves over-
all classification performance. The best results were achieved by the ‘LYRICS
+ RP’ setting (C3), closely followed by the ‘LYRICS + SSD’ experiment (C2).

The higher-dimensional the data for the lyrics experiments is, the higher is its

classification accuracy, implying that there is even more discriminating informa-
tion contained in lyrics (see experiments L1 - L4), which is not covered in this
context because of the limitations of the simple concatenation approach. For
combination experiments (C1 - C3) we use balanced combinations of features,
i.e. the dimensionality of the lyrics component always equals the dimensionality
of the audio feature component.
For statistical significance testing we used a paired T-test for a significance
level of α = .05. Results showed that A2 performs better than A1 (p = .0143),
but there is no significant difference between A2 and A3 (p = .9353). Further,
it is shown that C3 performed better than both A2 (p = .1934) and L3 (p =
.0129). However, the results are not significantly different from experiment L4
(p = .1755), leading to the conclusion that high-dimensional lyrics data only is a
strong basis for a classifier. Hence a classifier based on differing numbers of lyrics
than audio features, e.g. more dimensions in the lyrics than in the audio space,
might further improve classification accuracy. Yet, by combining lyrics and audio
(C2) the same performance was achieved at a fraction of the dimensionality.

4 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956833333333">
We showed that the combination of multi-modal features for information re-
trieval increases classification accuracy. Future work will deal with better means
of combining classification results. Ensemble methods might prove useful, over-
coming the limitation of implicit feature weighting encountered in the current
setting. Additionally, stylistic features for text genre classification are currently
being integrated.
