Our work focuses on investigating novel ways of efficient processor simulation using just-in-
time compilation techniques. We can automatically generate a cycle-accurate simulator from a
processor description that captures hardware structure and instruction set. The simulator employs
an adaptive two-level just-in-time compilation scheme based on LLVM to attain high simulation
speeds.
As the main source of slowdown during simulation we identified the LLVM code generator.
We reduced compilation time in our own experimental code generator by an order of magnitude
compared to LLVM’s original backend. Current work aims at leveraging instruction descriptions
already available in LLVM to extend the coverage of our fast JIT code generator.

Embedded systems have become a prevalent part of our everyday life and it is very un-
likely that this trend is going to decline anytime soon. To meet the increasing performance
requirements of modern embedded systems, application specific instruction-set processors
(ASIPs) often provide a viable trade-off between computing power and opposing metrics
such as power consumption or chip area. With today’s short production cycles and proces-
sors custom-built for a single application the need for simulators is further amplified. At the
same time, application specific instruction-sets demand a high level of flexibility from the
simulators; for each new ASIP a corresponding simulator is required.
Previously our group had developed a processor description language that captures the
instruction set and hardware structure of a processor. Using those processor descriptions,
various design tasks can be automated, e. g., we can automatically customize a compiler
backend, generate hardware models and we can generate a cycle-accurate simulator for the
modeled processor. This effectively allows to shorten development turnaround times.

Currently, the simulators use a mixed approach based on two levels of dynamic compi-
lation via the LLVM just-in-time (JIT) compiler. In the first level, the code is compiled with
all optimizations turned off. The second level identifies hot traces and recompiles them with
optimizations enabled. Most time is spent in first-level compilation. Our work concentrates
on reducing that compile-time.

2 LLVM JIT Compiler
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958444444444">
Even with optimizations turned off, LLVM executes almost 1.5 million instructions in the
JIT compiler for a minimal basic block that consists of a single return instruction. We have
implemented an experimental x86-64 code emitter that generates code directly from LLVM
intermediate representation (IR) to investigate the potential of bypassing the existing back-
end that is not optimized for JIT compiling. By using our experimental emitter we can reduce
the time spent in the JIT roughly by an order of magnitude for that trivial basic block. We
expect this speedup to grow with larger basic blocks as the regular backend aims at quality
code while the experimental codegen emits machine code equivalents of LLVM IR directly.
The main drawback of this experimental code emitter is that the IR to machine code map-
ping is hand-coded instead of generated from instruction descriptions readily available in
LLVM. The coverage of IR therefore remains limited if one does not want to duplicate the
existing x86-64 backend by hand. The nature of the LLVM instruction descriptions, how-
ever, prevents us from directly using them in the fast code emitter. While the descriptions
themselves are collected in a single place, the interpretation of the instruction descriptions
– the process that yields the machine code we want to emit – is distributed over the whole
backend.
Our ongoing research aims at leveraging the existing instruction descriptions to extend
the coverage of the fast JIT backend for LLVM. We do this by extracting parametrizable
chunks of machine code for each LLVM IR instruction from the existing backend. The chunks
are collected at compile time. At runtime – when the fast JIT backend compiles the simula-
tion code – the code emitter only has to iterate over IR instructions in a single pass assem-
bling the already prepared machine code chunks. A second pass then resolves relocations.
Instruction selection is strongly reduced in complexity in this fast JIT backend. Register
allocation and scheduling are left out completely as our primary concern is to reduce time
spent in the JIT compiler. The quality of the code being generated is of little concern as
regions executed more often will eventually be recompiled with the second-level JIT that
produces optimized code.

The EPICOpt project started in October 2009 and is scheduled to last until 2012. The work
described above is still in progress but first experimental results confirm the viability of our
approach. By drastically reducing the time spent compiling mostly cold regions of code, we
expect to gain a substantial increase in overall simulation speed. This will greatly add to the
attractiveness of cycle-accurate simulators generated from processor descriptions.
