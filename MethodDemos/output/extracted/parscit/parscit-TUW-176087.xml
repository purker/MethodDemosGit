Abstract. Reviews and few non-controlled studies showed the effectiveness of
several specific designed computer video-games as an additional form of treatment
in several areas. However, there is a lack in the literature of specially designed
serious-games for treating mental disorders. Playmancer (ICT European initiative)
aims to develop and assess a serious videogame that may help to treat underlying
processes (e.g. lack of self-control strategies) in Eating and Impulse control
disorders. Preliminary data will be shown.

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99996275">
To date, the use of new technologies increased in the treatment of several mental
disorders, including: obsessive-compulsive disorders [1] schizophrenia [2], eating
disorders (EDs) [3], and anxiety disorders [4]. Furthermore, additional virtual reality
approaches have been successfully applied by minor mental disorders, such as:
posttraumatic stress disorders [5, 6] and addictive behaviors [7]. As previously stated,
computer games, could serve as an additional form of treatment in several areas, such
as: schizophrenia [8], asthma [9], and motor rehabilitation [10]. Although, several
naturalistic studies have shown the usefulness of serious videogames for enhancing:
positive attitudes [11,12], problem solving strategies [13], and modifying abnormal
behaviors [14], there is a lack in the literature of specially designed serious-games for
treating mental disorders and of controlled studies. Based on the current difficulty to
treat some specific areas (e.g. some personality traits, attitudinal and emotional aspects,

impulsivity), in Eating disorders (ED) and Pathological gambling (PG), even after
using evidence based psychological therapies, the purpose of Playmancer was to create
and design a serious videogame that may help to treat these factors. Hence, the purpose
of this presentation is to introduce the current state of this innovative research, showing
the design of the study and preliminary results. The final goal of this research is to
analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of using a serious videogame, as additional
therapy tool, for treating mental disorders (namely ED and PG), when compared with a
comparison group, where no additional videogame has been used.

1. Methods
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.87938">
1.1. Type of study and participants
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999627333333333">
A prospective longitudinal cohort study (patients and controls), following a quasi-
experimental design, is being used. 60 Bulimia nervosa and 60 PG patients are
participating in this study. All of them fulfill DSM-IV criteria for those pathologies.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.951842">
1.2. Procedure
Psychometric and physiological measures administered previous to treatment, at the
end of treatment and at 3 and 6 follow-up, will be used for the assessment of therapy
outcome. All cases will be assigned to two conditions: standard cognitive-behavioral
therapy (CBT) + weekly videogame vs. CBT without videogame.

<bodyText confidence="0.990513">
Videogame: The 3D environment videogame to be used, “Islands”, which is being
created and developed within the European research project PlayMancer [16], to
modify underlying attitudinal, cognitive, and emotional processes of specific mental
disorders. Islands may help to improve the player’s, relaxation, planning skills and self-
control strategies.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): The specialized CBT program will be composed
of 16 individual out-patient weekly sessions, of manualized and validated program.

2. Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963">
In this presentation, we have introduced PlayMancer, and shown preliminary results of
a first pilot trial. The PlayMancer platform relies on a modular architecture and brings
together state of the art techniques from multimodal interaction, 3D engines, speech,
and facial emotion recognition. An association between video gaming and
physiological and emotional reactions of users will be demonstrated.

3. Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999565285714286">
The potential of serious games has been demonstrated thoroughly from both a research
and a business standpoint. It seems that in last years, serious games have experimented
a steady growth of complementing treatments in the health area, and it seems that well-
produced games for health can lead to informational and potentially behavioral
improvements for their players. Despite this, there are few specifically designed studies
for treating specific traits in mental disorders. With the Playmancer video-game, new
interaction modes are provided by newly developed components.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.988716" genericHeader="method">
4. Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999809333333333">
Playmancer is an innovative approach, developed by multidisciplinary team, for
linking physiological, emotional and behavioral reactions of mental disorder patients.
The preliminary results of a pilot trial will be shown.
