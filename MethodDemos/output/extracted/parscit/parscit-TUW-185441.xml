Abstract — Shape analysis is a static program analysis tech-
nique for discovering properties of heap-allocated data struc-
tures. It is crucial to fending software bugs or to verify high-
level correctness properties. Various analyses have been in-
troduced but their relation in terms of precision often remains
unclear as different analyses use different abstractions of the
heap.
The aim of our work is to compare the precision of shape anal-
yses. We propose a novel algorithm based on three-valued
logic that extracts alias sets from shape graphs. Smaller sets
are more precise and indicate a more precise underlying shape
analysis. Using this metric, we experimentally compare – for
the ferst time – the relative quality of the state-of-the-art graph-
based shape analyses and make recommendations concerning
the combination of analysis parameters.

I. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995405">
Shape analysis is a static program analysis technique that
approximates the structure of the runtime heap. It is
closely related to pointer alias analysis but has its focus
on the heap with dynamically allocated, recursive data
structures. Using shape analysis results, many questions
about the runtime heap can be answered at compile time.
Such information is crucial to finding software bugs or to
verify high-level correctness properties.
Various analyses have been introduced but their rela-
tive quality in terms of precision often remains unclear
as analyses cannot be compared directly due to different
representations of analysis results.
The aim of our work is to compare parametrized ver-
sions of shape analyses by the size of may-alias sets ex-
tracted from shape analysis results. Smaller sets of pos-
sible aliases are more precise and indicate a more precise
underlying shape analysis. We are thus able to experi-
mentally evaluate precision and analysis runtime trade-
offs for parametrized versions of shape analysis algo-
rithms that use different heap representations.
Parametrized versions of the state-of-the-art graph-
based shape analyses, SRW [1] and NNH [2], were im-
plemented for C++ using the SATIrE program analysis
framework [3]. Measurements using the aforementioned
metric show the relative quality of analyses and the im-
pact analysis parameters have on precision and runtime.
We are the first to show that the NNH shape analysis is
strictly more precise than SRW. Experimental results al-
low us to make recommendations concerning the combi-
nation of analysis parameters.

II. CONTRIBUTIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983006375">
We implemented multiple instances of state-of-the-art
graph-based shape analyses for a subset of the C++ pro-
gramming language and developed an algorithm based
on three-valued logic that extracts alias information from
shape graphs.
Using this algorithm as a metric indicating the preci-
sion of the underlying shape analysis we are able to judge
the effects of individual analysis parameters on runtime
and precision of the analyses.
In detail, the contributions address theory, practice,
and assessment of shape analyses:
A. THEORY
We extended both the SRW [1] and the NNH [2] shape
analysis algorithms to model information flows from
function call sites to matching function bodies (inter-
procedural). In their original formulation the analyses
were intra-procedural.
We adapted the graph-based shape analyses from the-
oretical programming languages to a subset of C++.
We developed an algorithm for alias extraction from
shape graphs based on the technique described in Reps
et. al. [4]. Our algorithm improves precision in all cases
where objects in the heap are linked with two or more
indirections, e. g., linked lists with two or more elements.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.830367">
B. PRACTICE
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934">
We implemented the shape analyses and integrated them
into the SATIrE program analysis framework where sub-
sequent program analyses can now use them as powerful
alias analyses.
We added automatic annotation of shape- and alias
analysis results to SATIrE. The results obtained by the
analyses are available as annotations to the SATIrE ab-
stract syntax tree, as annotations to a program’s source
code, or as graphical visualization of a program’s control
flow graph.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.680252" genericHeader="method">
C. ASSESSMENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998626">
We evaluated shape analysis abstractions and discovered
that SRW shape analyses cannot contain must-alias in-
formation. We found that the SRW algorithm does not
always perform a strong update. Both findings were not
previously published.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.773948" genericHeader="method">
III. FINDINGS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999479907407407">
We systematically introduced five parameters to the
shape-based alias analyses to thoroughly evaluate their
effects on precision and runtime: (1) shape analysis al-
gorithm, (2) inter-procedural context information, (3) re-
taining temporary variables, (4) “common tails” exten-
sion, and (5) lazy/extensive alias testing. This results in
32 variations of shape-based alias analyses for our com-
parison.
Interpreting the observed results we were able to make
recommendations concerning the combination of analy-
sis parameters:
— Ignoring context information produced the worst
results and took the most time – always use context
information for shape analyses.
— We showed that the SRW shape analysis with an
extensive alias test cannot be more precise than the
lazy test on SRW graphs – always perform the lazy
test for the SRW analysis results to save time.
— NNH shape analysis and the lazy alias test pro-
duce a poor match: analysis runtimes are always
longer than with SRW but only in one case is the re-
sult (minimally) more precise; the higher precision
gained from NNH (and paid for by the longer anal-
ysis runtime) is lost in the lazy alias test as it merges
separate execution paths before the test which were
deliberately kept apart during analysis.
— Without temporary variables or the “common tail”
extension, SRW and NNH have comparable preci-
sion but SRW is roughly 5 times faster on our test
cases.
— Retaining temporary variables increased precision
for both SRW and NNH (23% and 21% smaller
alias sets, respectively) but also increased graph
sizes and therefore analysis runtime (3 times) –
here, the precision is expensive.
— The “common tails” alias test increased precision
only in combination with NNH, but then at no mea-
surable increased cost – a cheap precision increase
for an already precise analysis.
The number of may-aliases computed from the SRW-
or NNH shape analysis results is shown in Figure 1. A
more detailed discussion can be found in the first author’s
thesis [5].
In summary, we can say:
— NNH is strictly more precise than SRW in all ob-
served test cases
— The fastest variant is: SRW, with context infor-
mation, with lazy alias test, without common tails,
without temporary variables
— If more precision is required: NNH, with context
information, with extensive alias test, with com-
mon tails. Using our proposed metric we observed
a 28% gain in precision (reduced alias set sizes) at
36 times increased runtime for our test cases.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979818181818">
Our work was the first to implement the NNH shape anal-
ysis algorithm. We extended state-of-the-art graph-based
shape analyses to be used inter-procedurally on a subset
of C++ and improved the precision of the established al-
gorithm to extract alias information from shape graphs.
Our work features the first comparison of the relative
merits of the two state-of-the-art graph-based shape anal-
yses termed SRW and NNH. We were thus able to an-
swer a theoretically and practically important question,
as to which is the more precise shape analysis, which was
open since 1999.
