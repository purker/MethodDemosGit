Abstract. Human resource strategy can emerge within a decentralized decision
structure that gives managers autonomy to take responsive actions while overall
strategic direction is considered within a strategic planning process. This study
defines the concept of employee selection (especially strategic employee
selection) and hypothesizes on the positive correlation between innovation
characteristic in SME and value of strategic employee (the so called personnel
usefulness function). An empirical study illustrates the importance of both
elements in an integrative human resource strategy formation process
particularly for firms operating in the international environments.
Keywords: the personnel usefulness function, innovation characteristics, the
employee selection efficiency method.

Growing international competition necessitates increasing interest in new scientific
advancements and new solutions in the field of management based on innovation
transfer. Management staff forms a basis for expediting structural changes in the
regional economy. Staff is also a decisive factor for enhancing competitiveness. In the
knowledge based economy, while trying to maintain their position in the market or
access new markets, managers and employees need to improve their skills. This will
help in being able to use innovative technologies that exist all over the world.
It is generally recognized that effective human resource strategy formation
processes consist of central planning activities orchestrated at the corporate strategic
apex as well as emerging strategic decisions influenced by empowered managers
within the organization [Hill and Jones, 2000; Johnson and Scholes, 2002; Mintzberg
et al., 2003].

Companies operating in a market economy need to introduce changes to their
systems organisation and management. In business practice, decision making in a
company depends on activity, competition, changing external factors, e.g. technical
advancement, and results achieved by research and development departments,
knowledge, employees’ skills, social relations, know-how, and in particular, effective
investment in intellectual are an added value for a company. Companies investing in
human capital and work systems acquire competitive advantage thanks to their
readiness to learn and adopt new qualifications as well as efficient communication
and information channels.
Small and medium sizes enterprises (SMEs) that are about to make decision
concerning the employee selection tend to make a pre-evaluation of the efficiency of
this decision. There is a demand for developing the method that would diminish the
risk of an inadequate employee selection and at the same time would allow to solve
the problems which otherwise could be missed. A relevant framework to this issue is
based on a database referring to:
The SME, with defined the selected functional area, the business processes, the
workplaces and the personnel usefulness function for m-the employee in the n-th
SME: Wnm, n,m∈N is given. Allowing responding to the following question: Whether
a existed (given) the employee selection efficiency method based on the innovation
transfer in the small and medium enterprises (SME)?
It can be concluded that there is a need to define the criteria of the employee
selection (especially strategic employee) efficiency in the SME. Consequently an
appropriate reference model of the company should be developed to enable both
defining: the needs in the areas of functionality and the success evaluation of
employee selection. Such a model should provide a kind of guideline for the future
employee selection framework.
The decision as far as the selection of the proper employee should be preceded by
the management profitability assessment and the prospect advantage. In order to view
the prediction of the described innovation indicators the authorized consulting system
supporting decision making enabling to asses and forecast of knowledge in SMEs
(software) can be used (an Advisory Computer System for Forecasting the Efficiency
of a Strategic Employee Selection in Small and Medium Enterprises). This tool is the
implementation of the method of assessment of efficiency strategic employee
selection based on innovation indicators in the small and medium enterprises (SME),
which in this paper is presented.
This computer program could be a supplement as the module to the for example
compute system: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). ERP is process oriented
software that implementation can improve business processes running through
functional areas of a company onto computer system [Klaus at al., 2000].
Implementation of ERP is a strategic decision, that results about efficiency of
business processes, charge of resources and generally about compete and management
efficiency of the enterprise for the next years.

Knowledge in the paper is understood as improving qualifications and skills among
employees by participating in the implementation of innovative projects [Quinn et al.,
1996]. The process of managing intellectual capital should consist of two stages:
identifying and measuring. Literature distinguishes qualitative measures (e.g. Danish
project of IC measurement, ‘Scandia’ navigator, intengible assets monitor, IC model –
TM Rating, VCSTM, balanced result sheet, report by Saratoga Institute) and methods
of valuating intellectual capital (e.g. MV / MB, q-Tobin, CIV, KCE, VAICTM,
economic added value, IAV model, Strassmann’s method, IAMVTM, technology
broker) [Dudycz, T.; 2005], [Edvinsson, L., Malone, M.; 1997; Sokołowska, A.;
2005; Fitz-enz, J.; 2001; Nonaka, L.; Takeuchi, H.; 1995]. However, there are no
methods assessing the efficiency of decisions on acquiring knowledge based on
innovation transfer.
The author’s method was developed on the basis of the defined method for the
intellectual capital profitability assessment, including innovation characteristics. It
consists of 4 elements that is:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997960142857143">
(1) Experience in SMEs as regards investment in knowledge – so called the
reference SME model,
(2) Values of personnel usefulness function for m-th employee in the n-th
SME: Wnm,
(3) Innovation parameters (characteristics),
(4) Algorithm that enables values of personnel usefulness function: Wnm and
innovation characteristics binding – GMDH algorithm.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98984475">
The name of the method is an acronym that enhances the main operating methods,
namely: Efficiency – Selection – Employee.
In order to define the employee selection efficiency method (ESE) it is necessary
to find the answer for the following questions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.945018">
(1) What kind of SME is to be discussed?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999932">
A reference SME model proposed is based on literature and own scientific research
[Kasprzak, 2005]. It involved a survey of selected SMEs, in the sales area. The
research group consisted of 10 companies. Business processes were defined in detail
in each division of the company. The reference model has been developed (an SME
according to the regulation dated November 12, 1999, Commercial Law – Dz .U .Nr
101, poz 1178), which includes the following (1): business processes, employees
(description of workplaces), and value of personnel usefulness function for m-th
employee in the n-th SME. The business processes in each functional areas in SME
describe employees activities. The personnel usefulness function is defined for each
m-th employee, which realize the determined set of business processes.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.683943">
(2) What personnel usefulness function is to be considered?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.935356">
So, the following personnel SME usefulness function Wnm for the m-th employee
in the n-th SME: is proposed [Patalas – Maliszewska J., 2009]:
Wnm = f1(GK) +f2(PK) +f3(A) +f4(E) + f5(P) + f6(C) + f7(P), where: n, m∈ N,
The linear form of this function Wnm is chosen because all elements are equally
important to assess effectiveness and efficiency of investment in knowledge.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9350101">
• f1(GK) – the general knowledge function for the m-th employee in SME,

It is possible to receive indispensable data for account of value personnel

<listItem confidence="0.945883">
(3) What innovation characteristics are to be considered?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996746166666667">
The notion of innovation is treated flexibly depending on the field in which it is
used. The bases of being economically competitive enterprise in the SME sector are
directly initiative and innovation. The authors treat enterprise innovation as the ability
and motivation to search and commercially use the results of scientific researches. So,
following innovation characteristics are proposed [Krebs, I.; Patalas-Maliszewska, J.
2009].:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.980939277777778">
• Research and development cost.
• Employee&amp;apos;s number in SME in R&amp;D.
• R&amp;D centres ‘s number.
• R&amp;D cost financed by public funds (euro).
• R&amp;D cost financed by private funds (euro).
• Number of cooperation’s agreement with R&amp;D company.
• New product’s number/product’s number.
• Computer’s number.
• Patent’s number.
• Project’s number waiting for patent.
• Consulting cost per year.

• Employee&amp;apos;s number: education’s level: post doc.
• Employee&amp;apos;s number: education’s level: MBA study.
• Employee&amp;apos;s number: education’s level: post graduate study.
(4) In which way the information concerning value of personnel usefulness
function and the innovation parameters is to be accessed?
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.971217936170213">
The development of the employee selection decision model should be started with
collecting as much information as possible in relation to the structure and the
dynamics of the object (SME) in question. It can be a subjective knowledge which
involves the empirical data obtained as a result of the observation on the SMEs
functionality. This approach consists of the complete data because it has been
obtained in real situation. The elements in decision model (the value of the personnel
usefulness function, the value of the selected innovation parameters) were obtained as
a result of the research group consisted of 10 companies.
(5) What kind of algorithm can be used to combine value of personnel
usefulness function, value selected innovation parameters?
For defined object – the pair: the value of personnel usefulness function Wnm for
the m-th employee in the n-th SME and the value of selected innovation parameters
was making the empirical database of this indicators. The algorithm that enables the
both values was defined as GMDH (Group Method Data Handling), that involves the
following assumptions [Farlow S.J. (Ed.), 1984; Iwachnienko A.G., 1982]: a precise
description of the interdependence between the output and input data (the selected
innovation parameters with the characteristics of a given the personnel usefulness
function as well as the characteristic of the company – see Table 1) and minimum
modeling error. As a result of the algorithm GMDH implementation the best possible
polynomial (the polynomial decision-making model) was obtained which was
characterized by the lowest value criteria for regularity assigned to the pair object
(respectively – the personnel usefulness function and the innovation parameters).
The polynomial decision-making model will allow us to define the value of
personnel usefulness function Wnm for the m-th employee in the n-th SME for the
assessment of the efficiency of the selection of a senior management employee. On
the basis of the forecasted values of these indicators, the company’s board of directors
will make a decision about the employment of a strategic employee.
(6) What kind of decision supporting structure should be used in relation to the
employee selection?
Decision model is contracted on the basis of the database. It includes a complex
information about all the processes which could be observed while the database was
created, so both examples of successful and unsuccessful employee selection (value
of personnel usefulness function) are included. The application of empirical
knowledge enabled the application of GMDH as a modeling tool. In conclusion the
decision model, which was under examination, binds the selected indicators of
innovations characteristics with the value of the personnel usefulness function for m-
th employee in the n-th company. This restriction makes the decision making process
simple and brings it to some kind of pattern of the restriction propagation (chosen
decision making indicators of employee selection system under examination). It
means that, for some companies, the assessment of the effects which employee would
bring can be done on the basis of previously defined so called reference SME model.
In accordance with the date included in the value of the personnel usefulness
function database, including the innovations parameters all the variations of the
GMDH algorithms were investigated in the computer system supporting decision
making enabling to asses and forecast of knowledge in SMEs (an Advisory Computer
System for Forecasting the Efficiency of a Strategic Employee Selection in Small and
Medium Enterprises).

In order to solve the research problem, a polynomial decision-making model using
GMDH algorithm (see Formula 3.1) has been designed for an strategic employee
selection for an innovative SME. The model compiles all groups of the elements of
the method ESE. The generally form of the decision model, which will enable the
connection of the value of the personnel usefulness function to the value of the
innovation indicators is defined:

The stage of the employee selection variations and prediction testing of certain
innovations indicators allows for the introduction of the conclusions concerning the
ways in which the prediction is proceeded using ESE implementation method. The
main aim for the experts was to determine prediction value for the personnel
usefulness function for product manager. The object on which efficiency examination
is carried out in relation to the pair: a SME company, which considers the value of the
personnel usefulness function for a product manager and a properly defined the value
of the innovation indicators. The author’s software Advisory Computer System for
Forecasting the Efficiency of a Strategic Employee Selection in Small and Medium
Enterprises [Patalas-Maliszewska J., 2010] facilitates the proceeding of previously
described experiment.
So, the best possible polynomial (decision model) binding the selected indicators
like: x1 - the value of the personnel usefulness function for a product manager
(employee), x2 - research and development cost per year (using the author’s software)
– see Table 1, so-called the model of employee selection for SME is defined:
y (x1, x2) = 186379 – 1,37x1+0,83x2+0,4x12+0,0000008x22-0,0000003x1x2
(3.2.)
where: y (x1, x2) - SME performance index , W x1 - the value of personnel usefulness
function for product manager (employee), x2 - research and development cost per
year.
The model of employee selection for SME (see the Formula 3.1), which has been
defined, enables us to carry out a assessment of the employee chosen. As a result, on
the basis of the obtainable prediction values, it could be recommended for the
company to chose strategic employee, which was conditioned by the prediction of the
better values for the SME performance index.
The so-formulated decision model (see the Formula 1) on the basis of the data from
the Table 1 is built and can be changed depended on the implemented data.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960947368421">
The enterprises functioning in market economy have to implement changes in
systems of organization and management that they use. In economy practice making a
decision in enterprise is conditioned by competitors’ action, changing factors of
environments, eg. technical progress and results of the research works. Added value
for SME can be determine as knowledge, employees’ skills and abilities, social
relation, know-how, and particularly effective investing in intellectual capital. The
enterprises which invest in human capital and systems of work are achieved
competitive advantage because of their workers’ readiness to learning and qualifying
themselves and also thanks to effective information and communication transfers.
On the basis of the employee selection efficiency method – ESE the decision
model for a strategic employee efficiency chosen has been developed . It was
concluded that on the basis of the decision model the company of SME sector will
obtain the prediction of the defined strategic employee (the value of the personnel
usefulness function Wnm).
The method proposed shows just a concept associated with the assessment of the
employee selection in order to find their SME’s effective chosen. It means that, for
some companies, the assessment of the effects which employee would bring can be
done on the basis of previously defined indicators and the experience of those
companies.

This study defines the concept of employee selection (especially strategic employee selection) and hypothesizes on the positive correlation between innovation characteristic in SME and value of strategic employee (the so called personnel usefulness function). An empirical study illustrates the importance of both elements in an integrative human resource strategy formation process particularly for firms operating in the international environments. personnel usefulness function, innovation characteristics, the employee selection efficiency method.</abstract>
