The QXOR-SAT problem is the quantified version of the satisfiability problem XOR-SAT
in which the connective exclusive-or is used instead of the usual or. We study the phase
transition associated with random QXOR-SAT instances. We give a description of this
phase transition in the case of one alternation of quantifiers, thus performing an advanced
practical and theoretical study on the phase transition of a quantified problem.

The last decade has seen a growth of interest in the phase transition for Boolean satisfiability
(SAT). The clausal version of this problem shows a sharp transition in the sense that,
as the density of clauses is increased, formulas abruptly change from being satisfiable to
being unsatisfiable at a critical threshold point. Numerous experimental studies have been
performed in the investigation of phase transition for different variants of SAT problems,
thus giving strong evidence that the location of the transition coincides with such instances
that are hard to solve. In the meantime, theoretical studies have been conducted in order to
better understand such transitions. Determining the nature of the phase transition (sharp
or coarse)1, locating it, determining a precise scaling window and better understanding
the structure of the space of solutions turn out to be very challenging tasks, which have
aroused a lot of interest in different communities, namely mathematics, computer science
and statistical physics (see e.g., Dubois, Monasson, Selman, &amp; Zecchina, 2001). From a
computer science point of view, the success of the SAT problem is due to two features. The
problem SAT provides a framework in which problems within the complexity class NP can

be adequately expressed, and moreover practically efficient and highly optimized solvers are
available.
In order to obtain even stronger systems, many researchers have turned to a powerful
generalization of Boolean satisfiability, QSAT, where both universal and existential quan-
tifiers over Boolean variables are permitted. The QSAT problem permits the adequate
representation and modeling of problems having higher complexity—within the complexity
class PSPACE—and coming from various fields of computer science such as knowledge rep-
resentation, verification and logic. Recently, random instances of these quantified problems
have started to attract some attention (see Gent &amp; Walsh, 1999; Chen &amp; Interian, 2005).
Models for generating random instances have been developed, and experimental studies
have shown that in these models the QSAT property undergoes a phase transition that is
qualitatively similar to the one that appears for the ordinary SAT property. As stated by
Chen and Interian (2005), the hope is that research on developing competitive solvers for
quantified Boolean formulas could benefit from a better understanding of the typical be-
havior of random instances. Our study follows the pioneering work from Chen and Interian
(2005) who have made precise a promising model for generating random instances of the
QSAT problem. We use their model and apply it to the satisfiability problem QXOR-SAT
that we present below.
The difficulty of identifying transition factors and of performing theoretical explorations
of the SAT transition has incited many researchers to turn to a variant of the SAT problem:
the e-XOR-SAT problem. This satisfiability problem deals with Boolean formulas in con-
junctive normal form with e variables per clause, in which the “usual or” is replaced by the
“exclusive or” (we call clauses with “exclusive or” as the only connective XOR-clauses). This
problem has contributed to develop or validate techniques, thus revealing typical behaviors
of both random instances and their space of solutions for SAT-type problems (see, e.g.,
Cocco, Dubois, Mandler, &amp; Monasson, 2003; Creignou &amp; Daud´e, 2003; Dubois, Boufkhad,
&amp; Mandler, 2000; Dubois &amp; Mandler, 2002; Franz, Leone, Ricci-Tersenghi, &amp; Zecchina,
2001). Therefore, in order to understand how phase transitions evolve for satisfiability
when introducing quantified variables, it is quite natural to consider this problem.
Although the phase transition of random k-SAT is not yet well understood, generaliza-
tion to the quantified version has started for some years. The hope is that a generalization
of the problem can help in understanding the original one. Another way of gaining insight
into a hard problem is to look at some tractable variants. For these reasons in this paper
we embark on a theoretical study of the phase transition for the QXOR-SAT problem, which
is the quantified version of the XOR-SAT problem. Let us emphasize that this quantified
problem is, as the usual XOR-SAT problem, in P, and hence will permit us to provide exper-
iments at a large scale, thus giving useful intuition on the asymptotical behavior of random
instances. In order to efficiently solve an instance of the XOR-SAT problem, the clause set
is rewritten to a set of equations with coefficients from the finite field GF(2) and Gaussian
elimination is performed on the resulting set of equations. Gaussian elimination followed by
an examination of the quantifier structure provides an algorithm for the quantified version
of the XOR-SAT problem (for details, see Creignou, Khanna, &amp; Sudan, 2001, chap. 6.4).
Following the previous studies conducted by Gent and Walsh (1999) as well as Chen
and Interian (2005), we focus on formulas in conjunctive normal form having two quantifier

variables, and ϕ(X, Y ) is a conjunction of XOR-clauses. Moreover, any variable occurring in
ϕ(X, Y ) occurs in X or Y , i.e., the formula VX3Y ϕ(X, Y ) is closed. The model has several
parameters. First we consider (a,e)-QXOR-formulas, which are such that each clause in ϕ
has exactly (a+ e) variables, a from X and e from Y . The (a,e)-QXOR-SAT property is the
property for such a formula to be true. The second parameter is a pair (m, n) specifying the
number of variables in each quantifier block, i.e., in X and Y . The third parameter is L,
the number of clauses. To sum up, the generated formulas are of the form VX3Y ϕ(X, Y ),
where X has m variables, Y has n variables, each clause in ϕ has a variables from X and e
from Y and there is a total number of L clauses in ϕ. We are interested in the probability
that a formula drawn at random uniformly out of this set of formulas is true as n tends to
infinity (Section 2). We prove that the nature of the phase transition (coarse or sharp) for
(a,e)-QXOR-SAT is governed by the number of existential variables occurring in each clause.
For e = 2 and any a &amp;gt; 1, we prove in Section 3 that the (a,2)-QXOR-SAT has a coarse phase
transition. Moreover we give an expression of the distribution function of the threshold for
(a,2)-QXOR-SAT and we show how it is influenced by the different parameters of the model.
For e &amp;gt; 3, we prove in Section 4 that (a,e)-QXOR-SAT has a sharp phase transition—thus
getting the first proof of a sharp threshold for a natural quantified satisfiability problem.

a formula is true if, for every assignment to the variables X, there exists an assignment to
the variables Y , such that ϕ is true. Observe that, for closed formulas, the notions of truth
and satisfiability coincide. For this reason, we will use the two notions synonymously in the
following. We denote by (a,e)-QXOR-SAT the property for an (a,e)-QXOR-formula of being

(a,e)-XOR-clauses. We consider random formulas VX3Y ϕ(X, Y ) obtained by choosing uni-
formly independently and with replacement L clauses from all the possible N (a,e)-XOR-
clauses. Using the terminology of Chen and Interian (2005), these formulas correspond
to (a,e)-QXOR((m,n),L)-formulas. We are interested in estimating the probability that
a randomly chosen (a,e)-QXOR((m,n),L)-formula is true. We denote this probability by
Pr(m,n,L)((a,e)-QXOR-SAT), or shortly Pr((a,e)-QXOR-SAT) when no confusion can arise.
When restricted to the non-quantified case, e-XOR-SAT, i.e., when a=0, we omit the first
component in the subscript, thus discussing Prn,L(e-XOR-SAT), or shortly Pr(e-XOR-SAT).
We will show that the behavior of the (a,e)-QXOR-SAT property is bounded from
above and below by two monotone properties, namely the e-XOR-SAT property and the
Maximal rank property. Experiments will suggest that the right parameter in order to study
these properties is c, the ratio of the number of clauses over the number of existential vari-
ables. Moreover, according to the results obtained for e-XOR-SAT by Creignou, Daud´e, and
Dubois (2003), we know that the transition occurs when c &amp;lt; 1. Therefore, in the sequel we
will always suppose without loss of generality that L &amp;lt; n.

A natural question at this stage is to estimate the probability that a random matrix is
of maximal rank. In the following we will provide some experiments and theoretical results

ables and 10 000 universal variables with a ratio “number of clauses/number of existential
variables” varying from 0.1 to 1 in steps of 0.05 or 0.1. For each of the chosen values of
ratio, a sample of 1000 formulas were studied using the algorithm described in the work of
Creignou et al. (2001, chap. 6.4), thus deciding their truth (or satisfiability) as quantified
formulas. The proportion of true instances for each considered value of ratio has been plot-
ted in Figure 1. The same has been done for the other (a,2)-QXOR-SAT properties. Hence,
the different curves are independent from each other. For the 2-XOR-SAT experiment, we
used the same selection procedure over 10 000 existential variables. Again, Gaussian elim-
ination together with an examination of the quantifier structure were used to determine
the logical “status” (true or false) of every formula. Additionally, it has been computed
whether the matrix E has full rank or not. The curve 2-Max-rank shows the proportion
of systems with full rank and it corresponds to the 2-XOR-SAT curve in the same figure.
A close look at Figure 1 reveals that some points from the (a,2)-QXOR-SAT curves are
slightly below the (theoretical) lower bound given by the curve for 2-Max-rank. The reason
for this phenomenon is the independence of all the satisfiability curves from each other and
the “noise” induced by the finite sampling of problems. If we had chosen corresponding
problems with exactly the same existential part (and only the universal part varies), then
we would have got all satisfiability curves above the curve for 2-Max-rank.
The experimental results shown in Figure 1 suggest first that the two bounding proper-
ties, namely 2-Max-rank and 2-XOR-SAT are distinguishable, second that, when m = n, the
(a,2)-QXOR-SAT property coincides asymptotically with the 2-Max-rank property indepen-
dently of a ≥ 1, the number of universal variables per clause.

At another scale for m, for instance when m is constant, the experimental results re-
ported in Figure 2 suggest that the (a,2)-QXOR-SAT property is in between the two prop-
erties 2-Max-rank and 2-XOR-SAT.
In the following, we will validate the conjectures suggested by these experiments and
prove that the property (a,2)-QXOR-SAT coincides asymptotically with the 2-Max-rank
property as soon as m is tending to infinity with n, and that it is in between the 2-Max-rank
property and the 2-XOR property when m is a fixed constant. In particular, we will make
clear the connection between random (a,2)-QXOR-formulas and random labelled graphs.

fiability of such a system is strongly related to the existence of cycles in graphs. Indeed, we
construct a graph Ga(s) with n vertices and L weighted edges. For each existential variable
yi we have a vertex in Ga(s). For each equation yi ® yj = xi1 ® ... ® xia ® ε, we add the
edge fyi, yj} to Ga(s) with the label xi1 ® ... ® xia ® ε. A cycle is given by a sequence of
vertices (yi1 , ... , yi3) such that for 1 G j G s — 1, fyij , yij+1} is an edge in the graph, and
so is fyi3, yi1}. The cycle is said to be elementary if all the vertices in the sequence are

Proof: Suppose we have an elementary cycle with nonzero weight in Ga(s). Clearly, to
such a cycle corresponds a subsystem in s, for which there exists an assignment to X such
that no assignment to Y will satisfy it (see Example 3.2 for an illustration). Hence, s is
unsatisfiable.
Conversely, suppose there is no (elementary) cycle with nonzero weight in Ga(s). Take
an arbitrary truth assignment I for the (universal) variables in X and apply it to Ga(s).
Since I(x) ∈ {0, 1} for all x ∈ X, the weight at each edge can be reduced to a constant
from {0, 1} by addition modulo 2. Moreover, since each cycle in Ga(s) has zero weight, the
corresponding cycle in the “reduced” version, G&amp;apos;a(s), of Ga(s) has also zero weight. The
graph G&amp;apos;a(s) corresponds to a system with existential quantifiers only.
In order to obtain a satisfying truth assignment for the existential variables, it suffices to
apply the following procedure to each connected component of G&amp;apos; a(s). Consider an arbitrary
root vertex y and assign an arbitrary truth value v to it. We obtain a truth value for each
vertex in G&amp;apos;a(s) by performing a depth-first search starting from y. During the search, if
there is an edge (y&amp;apos;, y″) labelled with ε and y″has no truth value yet, then we set the value
for y″to the value of y&amp;apos; ⊕ ε. The assignment obtained in this way satisfies all the equations
since G&amp;apos;a(s) does not contain any cycle with nonzero weight.

The asymptotic behavior of the number of cycles in random graphs has been first investi-
gated by Erdös and R´enyi (1960), and made precise by Janson (1987) and Takäcs (1988).
This number converges in distribution to a Poisson law of parameter λ, where λ is the limit
of the average number of cycles as n, the number of vertices, tends to infinity.
This result can be easily extended to our model of labelled graphs. In particular,
Pr(Ga(s) has no (bad) cycle) −→ exp(−λ),
where λ is the limit of the the average number of (bad) cycles. A challenging task is now
to get a simple expression of lambda.
Let Y be the random variable that counts the number of cycles. Let C be the set
of all possible cycles. For any cycle c, we introduce the random variable Xc such that
Xc(Ga(s)) = 1 holds, if and only if Ga(s) contains the cycle c. The average number of
cycles is

The results obtained in the previous section, (6) and (7), together with the inequalities (3)

Proof: The proof is based on Proposition 3.3 and, as discussed in the previous section, on
an estimation of the number of bad cycles in the labelled graphs associated with random

expression of λm,a. Observe that each label on the edges of the graph associated with a

quite natural to associate to every cycle its length l, the sequence (N1, ... , N(ma)) of the
numbers of occurrences of each variable-label, and the parity ε = 0 or 1 of the number of
occurrences of the constant 1. The limit of the average number of cycles whose parameter

For a better readability, let us focus on the case a = 1. In this particular case, the label
of an edge is of the form xi ⊕ε, where ε = 0 or 1 and 1 ≤ i ≤ m. On the one hand, all cycles
of odd length are bad (for in the weight of such a cycle at least one of the coefficients of the
xi’s will be nonzero). On the other hand, there are two kinds of cycles of even length that
are bad. The ones in which the constant 1 appears an odd number of times, and the ones
in which one of the universal variables appears an odd number of times. Since, for m ≥ 1,

It can be observed from the experimental results shown in Figure 8 that, contrary to what
has been observed in the previous section, the three smooth lines connecting the con-
secutive points and corresponding to the transition of the three properties 3-Max-rank,
(a,3)-QXOR-SAT and 3-XOR-SAT are difficult to distinguish. Moreover, when n increases
(see Figure 9), the curves straighten and come closer one to each other, showing thus strong
empirical evidence that the transitions of the three properties coincide asymptotically, with
a sharp phase transition at the critical value c3 �z2 0.918 (which is the critical ratio for
3-XOR-SAT, see Dubois &amp; Mandler, 2002). We will show that, for e &amp;gt; 3, the introduction
of universal variables in XOR-formulas does not influence the sharp transition.
Theorem 4.1 For every e &amp;gt; 3 and any integer a, the (a,e)-QXOR-SAT property has a
sharp threshold which coincides with the one of the e-XOR-SAT property.

by Chen and Interian (2005) is mathematically tangible and provides the good parameters
in order to perform a mathematical analysis of the phase transition for quantified problems.
On the one hand, as observed for QSAT (Gent &amp; Walsh, 1999; Chen &amp; Interian, 2005),
we have proved that the nature of the transition is not influenced by the introduction
of universal variables. On the other hand, in contrast with QSAT, we have proved that
the location of the phase transition—the critical ratio—is the same for the two properties
XOR-SAT and QXOR-SAT, and that the difference of behavior between these two properties
occurs at the level of the distribution function.
