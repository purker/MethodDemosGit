Abstract. We introduce a new approach for establishing fixed-parameter
tractability of problems parameterized above tight lower bounds or below
tight upper bounds. To illustrate the approach we consider two problems
of this type of unknown complexity that were introduced by Mahajan,
Raman and Sikdar (J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 75, 2009). We show that a
generalization of one of the problems and three nontrivial special cases
of the other problem admit kernels of quadratic size.

A parameterized problem 17 can be considered as a set of pairs (I, k) where I
is the main part and k (usually an integer) is the parameter. 17 is called fixed-
parameter tractable (FPT) if membership of (I, k) in 17 can be decided in time
O(f (k)|I|c), where |I |denotes the size of I, f (k) is a computable function, and
c is a constant independent of k and I (for further background and terminology
on parameterized complexity we refer the reader to the monographs [7, 8, 16]).
If the nonparameterized version of 17 (where k is just a part of the input) is
NP-hard, then the function f (k) must be superpolynomial provided P =6 NP.
Often f (k) is “moderately exponential,” which makes the problem practically
feasible for small values of k. Thus, it is important to parameterize a problem
in such a way that the instances with small values of k are of real interest.
Consider the following well-known problem: given a digraph D = (V, A),
find an acyclic subdigraph of D with the maximum number of arcs. We can
parameterize this problem “naturally” by asking whether D contains an acyclic
subdigraph with at least k arcs. It is easy to prove that this parameterized
problem is fixed-parameter tractable by observing that D always has an acyclic
subdigraph with at least |A|/2 arcs. (Indeed, consider a bijection α : V →
{1, . . . ,|V |} and the following subdigraphs of D: (V, { xy ∈ A : α(x) &amp;lt; α(y) })
and (V, { xy ∈ A : α(x) &gt; α(y) }). Both subdigraphs are acyclic and at least one
of them has at least |A|/2 arcs.) However, k ≤ |A|/2 for every small value of k
and almost every practical value of IAI and, thus, our “natural” parameterization
is of almost no practical or theoretical interest.
Instead, one should consider the following parameterized problem: decide
whether D = (V, A) contains an acyclic subdigraph with at least IAI/2 + k
arcs. We choose IAI/2 + k because IAI/2 is a tight lower bound on the size of
a largest acyclic subdigraph. Indeed, the size of a largest acyclic subdigraph of
a symmetric digraph D = (V, A) is precisely IAI/2. (A digraph D = (V, A) is
symmetric if xy G A implies yx G A.)
In a recent paper [15] Mahajan, Raman and Sikdar provided several exam-
ples of problems of this type and argued that a natural parameterization is one
above a tight lower bound for maximization problems, and below a tight upper
bound for minimization problems. Furthermore, they observed that only a few
non-trivial results are known for problems parameterized above a tight lower
bound [10, 11, 13, 14], and they listed several problems parameterized above a
tight lower bound whose complexity is unknown. The difficulty in showing
whether such a problem is fixed-parameter tractable can be illustrated by the
fact that often we even do not know whether the problem is in XP, i.e., can
be solved in time O(IIIg(k)) for a computable function g(k). For example, it
is non-trivial to see that the above-mentioned digraph problem is in XP when
parameterized above the IAI/2 bound.
In this paper we introduce the Strictly Above/Below Expectation Method
(SABEM), a novel approach for establishing the fixed-parameter tractability
of maximization problems parameterized above tight lower bounds and mini-
mization problems parameterized below tight upper bounds. The new method
is based on probabilistic arguments and utilizes certain probabilistic inequalities.
We will state the equalities in the next section, and in the subsequent sections
we will apply SABEM to two open problems posed in [15].
Now we give a very brief description of the new method with respect to
a given problem Π parameterized above a tight lower bound or below a tight
upper bound. We first apply some reductions rules to reduce Π to its special
case Π&apos;. Then we introduce a random variable X such that the answer to Π is
YES if and only if X takes, with positive probability, a value greater or equal
to the parameter k. Now using some probabilistic inequalities on X, we derive
upper bounds on the size of NO-instances of Π&apos; in terms of a function of the
parameter k. If the size of a given instance exceeds this bound, then we know
the answer is YES; otherwise, we produce a problem kernel [7]. In many cases,
we obtain problem kernels of polynomial size.
In Section 3, we consider the LINEAR ORDERING problem, a generalization
of the problem discussed above: Given a digraph D = (V, A) in which each
arc ij has a positive integral weight wij, find an acyclic subdigraph of D of
maximum weight. Observe that W/2, where W is the sum of all arc weights,
is a tight lower bound for LINEAR ORDERING. We prove that the problem
parameterized above W/2 is fixed-parameter tractable and admits a quadratic
kernel. Note that this parameterized problem generalizes the parameterized

maximum acyclic subdigraph problem considered in [15]; thus, our result answers
the corresponding open question of [15].
In Section 4, we consider the problem MAx LIN-2: Given a system of m
linear equations e1, ... , em in n variables over GF(2), and for each equation ej
a positive integral weight wj; find an assignment of values to the n variables
that maximizes the total weight of the satisfied equations. We will see that
W/2, where W = w1 + • • • + wm, is a tight lower bound for MAx LIN-2. The
complexity of the problem parameterized above W/2 is open [15]. We prove
that the following three special cases of the parameterized problem are fixed-
parameter tractable: (1) there is a set U of variables such that each equation
has an odd number of variables from U, (2) there is a constant r such that each
equation involves at most r variables, (3) there is a constant ρ such that any
variable appears in at most ρ equations. For all three cases we obtain kernels
with O(k2) variables and equations. We also show that if we allow the weights wj
to be positive reals, the problem is NP-hard already if k = 1 and each equation
involves two variables.
In Section 5, we briefly mention minimization problems parameterized below
tight upper bounds, provide further discussions of problems considered in this
paper and point out to a very recent result obtained using our new method.

2 Probabilistic Inequalities

In our approach we introduce a random variable X such that the answer to the
problem parameterized above a tight lower bound or below a tight upper bound
is YES if and only if X takes with positive probability a value greater or equal
to the parameter k.
In this paper all random variables are real. A random variable is discrete if
its distribution function has a finite or countable number of positive increases.
A random variable X is a symmetric if —X has the same distribution function
as X. If X is discrete, then X is symmetric if and only if Prob(X = a) =
Prob(X = —a) for each real a. Let X be a symmetric variable for which the first
moment E(X) exists. Then E(X) = E(—X) = —E(X) and, thus, E(X) = 0.
The following is easy to prove [17].

See Sections 3 and 4 for applications of Lemma 1. Unfortunately, often X is not
symmetric, but Lemma 2 provides an inequality that can be used in many such
cases. This lemma was proved by Alon et al. [2]; a weaker version was obtained
by Hästad and Venkatesh [12].

Let D = (V, A) be a digraph with no loops or parallel arcs in which every arc
ij has a positive weight wij. The problem of finding an acyclic subdigraph
of D of maximum weight, known as LINEAR ORDERING, has applications in
economics [3]. Let n = |V  |and consider a bijection α : V → {1, ... , n}. Observe
that the subdigraphs (V, { ij ∈ A : α(i) &amp;lt; α(j) }) and (V, { ij ∈ A : α(i) &gt;
α(j) }) are acyclic. Since the two subdigraphs contain all arcs of D, at least one
of them has weight at least W/2, where W = Eij∈A wij, the weight of D. Thus,
W/2 is a lower bound on the maximum weight of an acyclic subdigraph of D.
Consider a digraph D where for every arc ij of D there is also an arc ji of the
same weight. Each maximum weight subdigraph of D has weight exactly W/2.
Hence the lower bound W/2 is tight.

LINEAR ORDERING ABOVE TIGHT LOWER BOUND (LOALB)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991881916666667">
Instance: A digraph D = (V, A), each arc ij has an integral positive
weight wij, and a positive integer k.
Parameter: The integer k.
Question: Is there an acyclic subdigraph of D of weight at least W/2+k,
where W = Eij∈A wij ?
Mahajan, Raman, and Sikdar [15] asked whether LOALB is fixed-parameter
tractable for the special case when all arcs are of weight 1 (i.e., D is unweighted).
In this section we will prove that LOALB admits a kernel with O(k2) arcs;
consequently the problem is fixed-parameter tractable. Note that if we allow
weights to be positive reals, then we can show, similarly to the NP-completeness
proof given in the next section, that LOALB is NP-complete already for k = 1.
Consider the following reduction rule:

Reduction Rule 1 Assume D has a directed 2-cycle iji; if wij = wji delete
the cycle, if wij &gt; wji delete the arc ji and replace wij by wij − wji, and if
wji &gt; wij delete the arc ij and replace wji by wji − wij.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998292">
It is easy to check that the answer to LOALB for a digraph D is YES if and
only if the answer to LOALB is YES for a digraph obtained from D using the
reduction rule as long as possible.

It is easy to see that X(α) = P{ wij : ij ∈ A, α(i) &amp;lt; α(j) } − W/2. Thus, the
answer to LOALB is YES if and only if there is a bijection α : V → {1, ... , n}
such that X(α) ≥ k. Since E(Eij) = 0, we have E(X) = 0.
Let W(2) = PijEA w2ij. We will prove the following:
Lemma 4. E(X2) ≥ W(2)/12.
Proof. Let N+(i) and N (i) denote the sets of out-neighbors and in-neighbors
of a vertex i in D. By the definition of X,

Case 2a: |{i, j} ∩ {p, q} |= 1 and i = p. Since the probability that i &amp;lt;
min{j, q} or i &gt; max{j, q} is 2/3, EijEiq = wijwiq with probability 23 and EijEiq =

Now we can prove the main result of this section.
Theorem 1. The problem LOALB admits a kernel with O(k2) arcs.
Proof. Let H be a digraph. We know that the answer to LOALB for H is YES
if and only if the answer to LOALB is YES for a digraph D obtained from H
using Reduction Rule 1 as long as possible. Observe that D is an oriented graph.
Let B be the set of bijections from V to {1, ... , n}. Observe that f : B —&gt; B
such that f (α(v)) = IV I + 1 — α(v) for each α E B is a bijection. Note that
X(f(α)) = —X(α) for each α E B. Therefore, Prob(X = a) = Prob(X = —a)
for each real a and, thus, X is symmetric. Thus, by Lemmas 1 and 4, we have
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.985298666666667">

Prob( X &gt; W(2)/12 ) &gt; 0. Hence, if W(2)/12 &gt; k, there is a bijection
α : V —&gt; {1, ... , n} such that X(α) &gt; k and, thus, the answer to LOALB (for
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999539923076923">
both D and H) is YES. Otherwise, IAI &amp;lt; W(2) &amp;lt; 12 • k2. ❑
We close this section by outlining how Theorem 1 can be used to actually find
a solution to LOALB if one exists. Let (D, k) be an instance of LOALB where
D = (V, A) is a directed graph with integral positive arc-weights and k &gt; 1 is an
integer. Let W be the total weight of D. As discussed above, we may assume
that D is an oriented graph. If IAI &amp;lt; 12k2 then we can find a solution, if one
exists, by trying all subsets A&apos; C_ A, and testing whether (V, A&apos;) is acyclic and
has weight at least W/2 + k; this search can be carried out in time 2O(k2). Next
we assume IAI &gt; 12k2. We know by Theorem 1 that (D, k) is a YES-instance; it
remains to find a solution.
For a vertex i E V let dD(i) denote its unweighted degree in D, i.e., the
number of arcs (incoming or outgoing) that are incident with i. Consider the
following reduction rule:
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.474386">
Reduction Rule 2 If there is a vertex i E V with IAI — 12k2 &gt; dD(i), then
delete i from D.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.9944086875">
Observe that by applying the rule we obtain again a YES-instance (D — i, k)
of LOALB since D — i has still at least 12k2 arcs. Moreover, if we know a
solution D&apos;i of (D — i, k), then we can efficiently obtain a solution D&apos; of (D, k):
if EjeN+(i) wij &gt; EjeN−(i) wij then we add i and all outgoing arcs ij E A
to D&apos;i; otherwise, we add i and all incoming arcs ji E A to D&apos; i. After multiple
applications of Rule 2 we are left with an instance (D0, k) to which Rule 2 cannot
be applied. Let D0 = (V0, A0). We pick a vertex i E V0. If i has a neighbor j
with dD0 (j) = 1, then IA0I &amp;lt; 12k2, since IA0I — dD0 (j) &amp;lt; 12k2. On the other
hand, if dD0(j) &gt; 2 for all neighbors j of i, then i has less than 2•12k2 neighbors,
since D0 — i has less than 12k2 arcs; thus IA0I &amp;lt; 3 • 12k2. Therefore, as above,
time 2O(k2) is sufficient to try all subsets A&apos;0 C_ A0 to find a solution to the
instance (D0, k). Let n denote the input size of instance (D, k). Rule 2 can
certainly be applied in polynomial time nO(1), and we apply it less than n times.
Hence, we can find a solution to (D, k), if one exists, in time nO(1) + 2O(k2).
Recall that a kernelization reduces in polynomial time an instance (I, k) of
a parameterized problem to a decision-equivalent instance (I&apos;, k&apos;), its problem

kernel, where k&apos; &amp;lt; k and the size of I&apos; is bounded by a function of k. Solutions
for (I, k) and solutions for (I&apos;, k&apos;) are possibly unrelated to each other. We call
(I&apos;, k&apos;) a faithful problem kernel if from a solution for (I&apos;, k&apos;) we can construct a
solution for (I, k) in time polynomial in III and k. Clearly the above (D0, k) is
a faithful kernel.

4 Max Lin-2
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.942296">
Consider a system of m linear equations e1, ... , em in n variables z1, ... , zn over
GF(2), and suppose that each equation ej has a positive integral weight wj,
j = 1, ... , m. The problem MAX LIN-2 asks for an assignment of values to
the variables that maximizes the total weight of the satisfied equations. Let
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.949597">
W = w1 + ••• + wm.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998173161290323">
To see that the total weight of the equations that can be satisfied is at least
W/2, we describe a simple procedure suggested in [12]. We assign values to the
variables z1, ... , zn one by one and simplify the system after each assignment.
When we wish to assign 0 or 1 to zi, we consider all equations reduced to the
form zi = b, for a constant b. Let W&apos; be the total weight of all such equations.
We set zi := 0, if the total weight of such equations is at least W&apos;/2, and set
zi := 1, otherwise. If there are no equations of the form zi = b, we set zi := 0.
To see that the lower bound W/2 is tight, consider a system consisting of pairs
of equations of the form EiEI zi = 1 and EiEI zi = 0 where both equations have
the same weight.
The parameterized complexity of MAX LIN-2 parameterized above the tight
lower bound W/2 was stated by Mahajan, Raman and Sikdar [15] as an open
question:
MAX LIN-2 PARAMETERIZED ABOVE TIGHT LOWER BOUND (LINALB)
Instance: A system S of m linear equations e1, ... , em in n variables
z1, ... , zn over GF(2), each equation ei with a positive integral weight
wi, i = 1, 2, ... , m, and a positive integer k. Each equation ej can be
written as EiEIj zi = bj, where 0 =6 Ij C {1, ... , n}.
Parameter: The integer k.
Question: Is there an assignment of values to the variables z1, ... , zn
such that the total weight of the satisfied equations is at least W/2 + k,
where W = Emi=1 wi?
Let rj be the number of variables in equation ej, and let r(S) = maxmi=1 rj.
We are not able to determine whether LINALB is fixed-parameter tractable or
not, but we can prove that the following three special cases are fixed-parameter
tractable: (1) there is a set U of variables such that each equation contains an
odd number of variables from U, (2) there is a constant r such that r(S) &amp;lt; r,
(3) there is a constant ρ such that any variable appears in at most ρ equations.
Notice that in our formulation of LINALB it is required that each equation
has a positive integral weight. In a relaxed setting in which an equation may
have any positive real number as its weight, the problem is NP-complete even

for k = 1 and each rj = 2. Indeed, let each linear equation be of the form
zu + zv = 1. Then the problem is equivalent to MAxCuT, the problem of
finding a cut of total weight at least L in an undirected graph G, where V (G)
is the set of variables, E(G) contains (zu, zv) if and only if there is a linear
equation zu + zv = 1, and the weight of an edge (zu, zv) equals the weight of
the corresponding linear equation. The problem MAxCuT is a well-known NP-
complete problem. Let us transform an instance I of MAxCuT into an instance
I&apos; of the “relaxed” LiNALB by replacing the weight wi by w&apos;i := wi/(L − W/2).
We may assume that L − W/2 &gt; 0 since otherwise the instance is immediately
seen as a YES-instance. Observe that the new instance I&apos; has an assignment of
values with total weight at least W&apos;/2 + 1 if and only if I has a cut with total
weight at least L. We are done.
Let A be the matrix of the coefficients of the variables in S. It is well-known
that the maximum number of linearly independent columns of A equals rankA,
and such a collection of columns can be found in time polynomial in n and m,
using, e.g., the Gaussian elimination on columns [4]. We have the following
reduction rule and supporting lemma.

and only if S is a YES-instance. Moreover, T can be obtained from S in time
polynomial in n and m.

<bodyText confidence="0.9990412">
Proof. If t = n, set T := S, so assume that t &amp;lt; n. The remark before the lemma
immediately implies that T can be obtained from S in time polynomial in n and
m. Let S&apos; be a system of equations from S and let T&apos; be the corresponding
system of equations from T. It is sufficient to prove the following claim:
There is an assignment of values to z1, ... , zn satisfying all equations in S&apos;
and falsifying the rest of equations in S if and only if there is an assignment
of values to zil, ... , zit satisfying all equations in T&apos; and falsifying the rest of
equations in T.
Let an assignment z0 of values to z = (z1, ... , zn) satisfy all equations of S&apos;
and falsify the equations of S&apos;&apos;, where S&apos;&apos; = S S&apos;. This assignment satisfies
all equations of R, the system obtained from S by replacing the right hand side
bj of each equation in S&apos;&apos; by 1 − bj. Note that R has the same matrix A of
coefficients with columns a1, ... , an. Let a column ai G6 {ail,. . . , ait }. Then, by
definition of ail, ... , ait, ai = λ1ail + · · · + λtait for some numbers λj G {0, 1}.
Knowing the numbers λj, we may eliminate a variable zi from R by replacing ai
with the sum of all columns from {ail , ... , ait } for which λj = 1 and carrying
out the obvious simplification of the system. Thus, we may eliminate from R
all variables zi G6 {zil, ... , zit } and get yil ail + · · · + yit ait = b&apos;, where b&apos; is the
right hand side of R and each yj G {0, 1}. Now replace, in the modified R, the
right hand side b&apos;j of each equation corresponding to an equation in S&apos;&apos; by 1− b&apos;j

equations in T&apos;&apos; = T \ T&apos;.
Suppose now that (yi1, ... , yit) satisfies all equations of T&apos; and falsifies all
equations in T&apos;&apos;. Then (y1, ... , yn), where yj = 0 if j E6 {i1, ... , it}, satisfies
all equations of S&apos; and falsifies all equations in S&apos;&apos;. Thus, the claim has been
proved. ❑
Consider the following reduction rule for LINALB used in [12].
</bodyText>
<construct confidence="0.6929145">
Reduction Rule 4 If we have, for a subset I of {1, 2, ... , n}, the equation
PiCI zi = b&apos; with weight w&apos;, and the equation PiCI zi = b&apos;&apos; with weight w&apos;&apos;, then
we replace this pair by one of these equations with weight w&apos; + w&apos;&apos; if b&apos; = b&apos;&apos; and,
otherwise, by the equation whose weight is bigger, modifying its new weight to
be the difference of the two old ones. If the resulting weight is 0, we omit the
equation from the system.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.7904904">
If Rule 4 is not applicable to a system we call the system reduced under Rule
4. Note that the problem LINALB for S and the system obtained from S by
applying Rule 4 as long as possible have the same answer.
Let Ij C {1, ... , n} be the set of indices of the variables participating in
equation ej, and let bj E {0, 1} be the right hand side of ej. Define a random

We set zi = 0 if Ei = 1 and zi = 1, otherwise, for each i. Observe that Xj = wj
if ej is satisfied and Xj = −wj, otherwise.
Lemma 6. Let S be reduced under Rule 4. The weight of the satisfied equations
Pmis at least W/2 + k if and only if X &gt; 2k. We have E(X) = 0 and E(X2) =
j=1 w2j .
Proof. Observe that X is the difference between the weights of satisfied and
falsified equations. Therefore, the weight of the satisfied equations equals (X +
E(Q
W)/2, and it is at least W/2 + k if and only if X &gt; 2k. Since Ei are independent,
iCIj Ei) = QiCIj E(Ei) = 0. Thus, E(Xj) = 0 and E(X) = 0 by linearity of

Lemma 7. Let S be reduced under Rule 4 and suppose that no variable appears
in more than ρ &gt; 2 equations of S. Then E(X4) &amp;lt; 2ρ2(E(X2))2.
Proof. Observe that

where [m] = {1, ... , m}. Note that if the product XpXqXsXt contains a variable
Ei in only one or three of the factors, then E(XpXqXsXt) = A · E(ei) = 0, where
A is a polynomial in random variables El, l E {1, ... , n} \ {i}. Thus, the only
nonzero terms in (2) are those for which either (1) p = q = s = t, or (2) there
are two distinct integers j, l such that each of them coincides with two elements
in the sequence p, q, s, t, or (3) |{p, q, s, t} |= 4, but each variable Ei appears
in an even number of the factors in XpXqXsXt. In Cases 1 and 2, we have
E(XpXqXsXt) = w4p and E(XpXqXsXt) = w2jw2l , respectively. In Case 3,

2
at most 4 · (ρ − 1)2 4-tuples (p, q, s, t) E [m]4. To see this, first note that w2pw2q
and w2sw2t appear in our upper bound on E(XpXqXsXt) (with coefficient 1/2).
Therefore, there are only four possible ways for w2jw2l to appear in our upper
bound, namely the following: (i) j = p, l = q, (ii) l = p, j = q, (iii) j = s, l = t,
and (iv) l = s, j = t. Now assume, without loss of generality, that j = p and
l = q. Since S is reduced under Rule 4, the product XjXl must have a variable
Ei of degree one. Thus, Ei must be in Xs or Xt, but not in both (two choices).
Assume that Ei is in Xs. Observe that there are at most ρ −1 choices for s. Note
that XjXlXs must contain contain a variable Ei, of odd degree. Thus, Ei, must
be in Xt and, hence, there are at most ρ − 1 choices for t.
Therefore, we have

Case 1 of Theorem 2 is of interest since its condition can be checked in

<construct confidence="0.866113333333333">
Proposition 1. We can check, in polynomial time, whether there exists a set
U of variables such that each equation of S contains an odd number of variables
from U.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.991218125">
Proof. Observe that such a set U exists if and only if the unweighted system S&apos;
of linear equations over GF(2) obtained from S by replacing each bj with 1 has
a solution. Indeed, if U exists, set zj = 1 for each zj E U and zj = 0 for each
zj E6 U. This assignment is a solution to S&apos;. If a solution to S&apos; exists, form U
by including in it all variables zj which equal 1 in the solution. We can check
whether S&apos; has a solution using the Gaussian elimination or other polynomial-
time algorithms, see, e.g., [6]. ❑
Now we can prove the following:

<construct confidence="0.796636">
Theorem 2. Let S be reduced under Rule 4. The following three special cases

appears in at most ρ equations. In each case, there exists a kernel with O(k2)
equations and variables.

<bodyText confidence="0.9012778">
Proof. Case 1. Let z0 = (z0 1, ... , z0n) E {0, 1}n be an assignment of values
to the variables z1, ... , zn, and let —z0 = (z0 1, ... , z0n), where z0i = 1 — z0i if
zi E U and z0i = z0i , otherwise, i = 1, ... , n. Observe that f : z0 7→ —z0
is a bijection on the set of assignments and X(—z0) = —X(z0). Thus, X is a
symmetric random variable. Therefore, by Lemmas 1 and 6, Prob( X &gt; -,/m ) &gt;

<equation confidence="0.6951226">
Prob( X &gt;�y-mj=1 w2j) &gt; 0. Hence, if -,/m &gt; 2k, the answer to LiNALB is
YES. Otherwise, m &amp;lt; 4k2 and after applying Rule 3, we obtain a kernel with
O(k2) equations and variables.
Case 2. Since X is a polynomial of degree at most r, it follows by Lemma
3 that E(X4) &amp;lt; 26rE(X2)2. This inequality and the results in the previ-
ous paragraph show that the conditions of Lemma 2 are satisfied and, thus,
C -,/Pm ~ ( √m)

Prob X &gt; &gt; 0, implying Prob X &gt; &gt; 0. Consequently,

if 2k — 1 &amp;lt; -,/m/(4 . 8r), then there is an assignment of values to the variables
z1, ... , zn which satisfies equations of total weight at least W/2 + k. Otherwise,
2k — 1 &gt; -,/m/(4 . 8r) and m &amp;lt; 16(2k — 1)264r. After applying Rule 3, we obtain
the required kernel.
Case 3. If ρ = 1, it is easy to find an assignment to the variables that satisfies
all equations of S. Thus, we may assume that ρ &gt; 2. To prove that there exists
a kernel with O(k2) equations, we can proceed as in Case 2, but use Lemma 7
rather than Lemma 3. ❑
Remark 1. Note that even if S does not satisfy Case 2 of the theorem, T, the
system obtained from S using Rule 3, may still satisfy Case 2. However, we have
not formulated the theorem for S reduced under Rule 3 as the reduced system
depends on the choice of a maximum linear independent collection of columns
of A.

We have showed that the new method allows us to prove that some maximization
problems parameterized above tight lower bounds are fixed-parameter tractable.
Our method can also be used for minimization problems parameterized below
tight upper bounds. As a simple example, consider the feedback arc problem:
given a digraph D = (V, A) find a minimum set F of arcs such that D — F
is acyclic. Certainly, IAI/2 is a tight upper bound on a minimum feedback
set and we can consider the parameterized problem which asks whether D has a
feedback arc set with at most IAI/2—k arcs. Fixed-parameter tractability of this
parameterized problem follows immediately from fixed-parameter tractability

of LOALB, but we could prove this result directly using essentially the same
approach as for LOALB.
Theorem 2.1 in [1] allows one to obtain a smaller kernel for LOALB on dense
digraphs than given in our paper. The proof of Theorem 2.1 in [1] also uses a
probabilistic approach, but it is more specialized than SABEM.
It would be interesting to obtain applications of our method to other problems
parameterized above tight lower bounds or below tight upper bounds. One such
very recent application is given in [9], where an open problem due to Benny
Chor and described in [16] was solved.
