Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999863133333333">
As photographic technologies continue to develop, so too do the social practices surrounding their use.
The focus of this paper is on the social practices surrounding images captured from a new photographic
device – SenseCam – which, rather than capturing individual images when triggered by the user,
automatically captures a series of images. This paper is concerned with the use of SenseCam digital
images in social contexts where there is a professional purpose: supporting the collaborative reflective
practices of school teachers and university tutors as part of their professional development. Analysis of
video data collected from 16 in-situ case studies of reflective discussions show evidence that reflection
took place as defined in the literature. Further, the phototalk around SenseCam images was found to
benefit reflection in these social situations through promoting a rich shared understanding of the lesson
context: supporting return to the experience, sharing of background context, grounding conversations,
illustrating and providing evidence, and allowing people to see more. The paper concludes with a
discussion on how different features of SenseCam images, such as variable quality, lack of audio,
incompleteness, helped in this reflection or not. Finally implications from this work and participants
comments are used to suggest ways in which SenseCam may be used in the future in teacher and tutors
social reflection.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999983846153846">
With advances in digital photography there has been a growing interest in the novel ways that these
photos are brought into social practices and the ways in which people are evolving their photographic
habits. Whilst most of this work is focussed on the digital form of the stills camera, a different type of
digital photo is emerging in the sphere of lifelogging.
SenseCam is a prototype lifelogging device currently under development at Microsoft Research in
Cambridge (e.g. Williams and Wood 2004; Cherry 2005). It is a small wearable device combining a
digital camera with a number of built in sensors and is made to be worn by a person around their neck
like a pendant (see Figure 1). The sensors, which measure light, motion, sound, infra-red and ambient
temperature, are used to trigger digital still images to be taken at ‘good’ times when something interesting
may be happening. Currently ‘good’ is defined by the developer as when there is a sudden change in light
(which might happen when we move from one room to another), sound or temperature, or when the infra-
red data combined with motion detection suggests another person is nearby. On average 3 or 4 photos per
minute are triggered in this way. The camera also has a very wide angle, fish-eye lens which captures
most of what is the field of view of the wearer from a first person perspective. These combined features
allow the wearer to passively capture a whole day’s worth of images without having to press a trigger or
aim the camera, leaving their hands and attention free to get on with their everyday tasks. When
downloaded to a PC, the images can be viewed using a rapid serial visualization tool, playing somewhat
like a sped up movie (see Figures 2-7 for example images), and the whole day may only take around 10
minutes to review. In this way, SenseCam can be considered a ‘life-logging’ tool.
Much research to date with SenseCam has focused on its potential to record life experience as a support
to memory – indeed it has been shown to be an effective tool in supporting people with severe memory-
loss (Cherry 2005), and to support different aspects of ‘remembering’ and knowing’ for people with a
normal memory (Sellen et al. 2007). More recently, research has suggested that SenseCam images can
also evoke reflection on past life experiences (Harper et al. 2007; Harper et al. 2008); and that sharing
such images with others prompts reflection on own and others’ lives (Lindley et al. 2009). The focus of
this research has been very much on everyday life – the way SenseCam as a life-logging tool was
envisaged to be used. We have also shown that SenseCam can support reflection in a learning context,
where students used the images from a field trip to reflect on their experiences (Fleck and Fitzpatrick
2006).
In this paper, however, we consider the value of SenseCam images in a work setting: we explore the
potential of the device to capture aspects of professional experience and share these with others, espoused
as part of being a good reflective practitioner (Moon 1999). The professional practice we focus on is that
of teaching - in both school and university contexts. This is a domain in which another visual experience-
recording technology, video, has been advocated for over thirty years (Zuber-Skerritt 1984). We have
previously undertaken research with individual school teachers and university tutors using SenseCam for
self-reflection and have shown it to be useful (Fleck 2008). Here we expand on these findings and focus
on how SenseCam might be used in schools and universities to support reflection in social contexts:
specifically we look at how it can support reflective practice conversations between novice teacher peers,
novice teachers and their mentors, and between trainee university tutors.

2 Teachers’ reflective practice
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999869652173913">
Reflective practice, inspired by the work of Schön (Schön 1983) , is a key element of professional
practice for teachers and tutors, and described as a ‘main mission’ (Manouchehri 2002) of teacher
training. Schön’s core idea is that in certain professions such as teaching, nursing or social work, where a
practitioner will often have to deal with real world messy situations that cannot easily be mapped onto a
professional rule book for action, professionals can, over time, learn to function very well. He suggests
this occurs through a process of reflection-in and reflection-on practice where reflecting-on-action
involves the practitioner looking back on a practice experience and becoming much more aware of what
was going on that time, including thinking about what actions or judgments were made and why. Over
time the practitioner will build up a repertoire of techniques and expectations, the knowledge becomes
tacit and this is what makes them an expert. Schön considers reflection to be the means by which experts
can relate theory to practice, develop their own personal theoretical understanding and to guide future
action.
For teachers, reflective practice is regarded as important to allow them to develop a more complex
understanding of teaching: teachers are encouraged to reflect after all lessons they have taught or
observed. Specifically this reflection is meant to allow teachers to analyze what they’re doing (Reinman
1999), integrate and reconstruct knowledge and ideas (Reinman 1999; Davis 2006), so they can adapt and
improve their practice (Reinman 1999; Ward and McCotter 2004), and have a positive impact on their
students’ learning (Leung and Kember 2003; Ward and McCotter 2004; Parsons and Stephenson 2005).
Reflective practice is considered important for ‘bridging the gap’ between theory and practice (Cannings
and Talley 2003; Parsons and Stephenson 2005). Davis (2006) suggests that features indicative of
productive reflection on practice for teachers involve: providing reasons for decisions; giving evidence
for claims; generating alternatives; questioning assumptions; identifying the results of teaching decisions;
and evaluating one’s teaching.

2.1 Social reflection and discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999899578947369">
Whilst reflection is often considered an individual endeavour, it is also a developmental process - and
people can learn to become more reflective over time with support from other people (Collier 1999; Ward
and McCotter 2004; Lee 2005). It is in these supported social reflection situations that this paper explores
the potential of SenseCam to support teachers’ and tutors’ reflective practice.
Much of the training of teachers takes place on the job, with support for the development of their
reflective practice being given both in formal structured ways and in more ad-hoc ways as time permits.
Discussion provides a key part of this support, including discussion of teaching experiences with a more
experienced teacher as mentor, or discussion between peers (Lee 2005; Parry In submission). Similarly,
trainee University tutors, who do not have access to the same structured support network as teachers, are
encouraged to discuss their early teaching experiences with each other.
Such discussions have been shown to be beneficial to trainees’ reflection: for example, a mentor can
structure trainee teachers’ reflection, question their assumptions and interpretations of events, and offer
alternate ideas or explanations. The mentor can also share with the trainee their own experiences, and
direct attention to incidents that a novice teacher may have overlooked (Lee 2005). Peers can play a
similar role: drawing each other’s attention to aspects of a lesson overlooked by the other, making
suggestions for how things could be done differently; and sharing their own insights and experiences with
each other (Manouchehri 2002; Parsons and Stephenson 2005; Parry In submission). In addition, trainee
teachers have reported that they favour reflecting with someone else since they find reflection by
themselves a difficult and tiring activity (Hatton and Smith 1995).

2.1.1 Current practices of social reflection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980777777778">
Currently, social reflection discussions take place in a variety of ways within the teacher training
curriculum in England and Wales. Firstly, when on placement at a school, a trainee teacher will be
formally observed on a number of occasions by a senior teacher from the school acting as mentor and a
tutor from university. This is always followed up with a session during which the mentor or tutor gives
feedback structured by the formal observation form they have completed and setting goals for the
trainee’s development based on this. Formal observation forms vary and topics for reflection can be
broad, including headings such as teaching and learning, classroom organization, management of
pupil activities, classroom activities, and management of pupil behaviour. A trainee teacher will also
undergo regular (often weekly, up to an hour) meetings with their mentor during which administrative
tasks are attended to and progress and experiences are discussed. These meetings are usually not formally
structured, and the mentor may have not have had the opportunity to observe the trainee teaching in the
past week. More informal discussions also happen ad hoc between trainees and more experienced
teachers, sometimes after a lesson that the trainee has observed been observed in themselves, or have co-
taught.
Similarly, informal discussion takes place in the school staffroom between lessons, where groups of
trainees often ‘hang out’ together. More formally, trainees also undergo weekly sessions with their peers
where aspects of teaching such as behaviour and classroom management are raised and discussed. There
are similar opportunities for discussion at university with subject colleagues, and trainees are encouraged
to keep up communication with university subject colleagues via email whilst on placement at schools.
In addition, there are various initiatives within schools where trainees are encouraged to observe each
other teaching and discuss this. One of the schools where this research was conducted was experimenting
with pair teaching (or pair mentoring) where two trainees shared the same mentor. So they shared mentor
meetings, taught lessons together and observed each other teaching regularly.
For trainee University tutors there is much less formal training and support, however the tutors who took
part in this study were encouraged to observe their peers tutoring as part of their Associate Tutor Training
programme. During these observations, peers are asked to fill in an observation form similar in content to
the teachers’ formal observation form, which is then used as a basis for discussion later.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.851758">
2.1.2 Technology and social reflection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99790494">
In addition to the more common practice of using observation forms or notes to structure reflective
discussion, video recordings have also been used as a basis for reflection and discussion in the teaching
domain (McDonnell et al. 2002; Sherin and van Es 2002). Whilst sharing and discussing experiences,
video has been found useful to: provide evidence in support of an idea or theory; support the making of
links between own and other’s experiences; and through stimulating storytelling and discourse, provide
an insight into each other’s understanding of experiences of teaching (Hutchinson and Bryson 1997;
Sharpe et al. 2003). In return discussion can help in noticing things in the video that might be missed
alone (Chuang and Rosenbusch 2005), and enabling consideration of different perspectives on own action
highlighting assumptions and giving insight into own beliefs (Jones and McNamara 2004).
However, while the benefits of using video to support reflective practice are becoming well understood, it
is rarely used as part of everyday reflective practice. This may be because there are issues associated with
obtaining a good recording of a lesson (particularly audio), often leading to time consuming and intrusive
set-ups (Sharpe et al. 2003; Jones and McNamara 2004). In addition, viewing video takes time (generally
real time) and for this reason it is often edited before reflection sessions (e.g. Sharpe et al. 2003;
Thomson et al. 2005; Thomson et al. 2005) which is again time consuming. In contrast the features which
make SenseCam an ideal lifelogging tool, could provide a number of benefits in a tool to support the
reflective practice of teachers and tutors who work in hectic environments. These benefits include that it
requires almost no time to set up before a lesson and no conscious attention or consideration of what to
capture during it. Images can then be downloaded to a PC without prior editing and all images can easily
be viewed within the short timeslots teachers and tutors typically have available for lesson reflections.
Certainly, SenseCam images have been reported to support individual’s reflection on everyday life
experiences (Harper et al. 2007; Harper et al. 2008; Lindley et al. 2009), and we have shown them to be
of value in supporting the self-reflection of novice teachers and tutors (Fleck, 2008). Similarly Lemon
(2007) also found digital still images of value in promoting her self-reflection on teaching experience,
though capturing them required another person to operate the camera.
In terms of supporting social reflection, digital still images have been found useful to support sharing of
experiences between people, both when all parties were present at the time of the event or to share events
with absent friends (Frohlich 2004; Kindberg et al. 2005). Previous research which describes the
discussion that occurs around such domestic images (often called ‘phototalk’) highlights how still images
can stimulate a process of ‘collective remembering’, where there is a reconstruction of events through
storytelling around images, and a sharing of them with others.
In summary, discussion and the sharing of experiences is identified as an important aspect in the
development of teachers’ reflective practice, and both video recordings and still images of lessons have
been found to be valuable in supporting this discussion in various ways. In other settings, discussion
around domestic still images has been described to occur in similar ways to professional reflective
discussions, providing further support for the potential value of images. Despite this potential though,
neither video nor still images are used regularly in teaching practice.
SenseCam, as a passive image capture tool recording only a series of still images, falls interestingly then
between video and a digital stills camera. Experiences to date in other areas suggest that it too might be
able to support reflective discussions: it has been found to evoke reflection in every day life situations
when images are shared amongst family members (Lindley et al. 2009); we have further found images of
value in supporting reflective discussion on a field-trip learning experience (Fleck and Fitzpatrick 2006).
To explore its potential in a professional practice situation, we conducted initial studies with novice
teachers and tutors using SenseCam for self-reflection and found it be useful (Fleck, 2008).
Therefore, it seems likely that such images could also prove valuable tools in supporting the social
reflective discussions between novice teachers and tutors with their supervisors and peers in the wide
variety of situations in which social reflective practice already occurs.
The focus of this paper then is to explore how SenseCam digital images can be used for professional
development by school teachers and university tutors in social reflective contexts. We do this through a
series of case studies that we ran in a variety of classroom settings.

3 Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999559666666667">
This research takes a case study approach. The cases on which this paper is based form part of a larger
body of research to understand the space of possibilities for how SenseCam might support the self and
social reflective practice of teachers and tutors in a variety of situations. The 16 cases discussed here (see
Table 1) are the social reflection cases in which trainee teachers and tutors reflect alongside their peers or
supervisors. All sessions were carried out within the constraints of day-to-day classroom practice of the
teacher or tutor.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.988946">
3.1 Participants
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998170875">
A total of 16 teachers with 10 of their mentors/other supervisors, and 8 university tutors participated in
this research. Participation was voluntary, and participants were recruited via their training institution.
The teachers, drawn from 8 English High Schools in the East Sussex and Cambridgeshire areas in the
UK, included both trainee teachers (Post Graduate Certificate of Education – PGCE - and Graduate
Teacher Program -GTP) and qualified novice teachers (newly qualified teachers –NQTs - in their first
year of teaching since qualifying; and recently qualified teachers – RQTs - in their second year). The
majority of university tutors were recruited from the Associate Tutor Training Course (ATTC) at the
University of Sussex.

3.2 Design
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998395722222222">
As the intention was to integrate the use of SenseCam into existing practices as much as possible, which
in reality vary widely, the details of each case and how SenseCam was used within it varied. However the
broad structure of SenseCam use and data collection in each case was similar. Each involved a classroom
session, in which a teacher or tutor wore SenseCam whilst teaching a class of students, and resulted in a
series of fish-eye photographs of the progress of the lesson from a first person perspective (see Figures 2-
7). This session was followed shortly afterwards by a review session, in which the captured SenseCam
images of the lesson were looked at (as described below) and the lesson discussed between participants.
All tutor cases and some teacher cases involved an element of peer discussion – sometimes after one peer
had observed the other teaching. Most teacher cases, on the other hand, involved discussions between the
teacher and their mentor during their regular mentor meeting slots. In most instances the mentor had not
been in the classroom at the time of the lesson. Cases 15, 7, 27, 28 and 12 all involved variations or
combinations on these themes (see Table 1). Cases 20-28 additionally explored using the camera from a
third person perspective by placing it somewhere in the room, however we do not focus on this here.
Cases also varied in other ways, such as participants’ level of teaching experience and the subject they
taught. For practical reasons, it is beyond the scope of this paper to provide a detailed analysis of each
individual case; instead we present the main findings which emerged from all cases, and summarise some
of the more salient distinguishing features of the cases in Table 1 below. Further details of each case can
be found in (Fleck 2008).

<bodyText confidence="0.999858833333333">
In all cases the review session was attended by the researcher and was conducted as soon as practical after
the classroom session, as favoured in the literature on reflective practice (Zuber-Skerritt 1984). In
preparation for it, the images from the lesson were downloaded from SenseCam to a laptop PC, a process
typically taking approximately 5 minutes for a 1 hour lesson. As usually only one lesson was recorded by
participants, resulting in around 130 images, no further editing of images was required before the review
session.
At the start of the review session the participants were instructed on how to use the viewing software and
were then given the option to automatically play in a movie mode or manually ‘click’ through the images
one at a time and reflect on the lesson together. No restrictions were placed on how participants chose to
make use of images in these review sessions. Most found the automatic play through too fast and chose to
manually click through, but did so rapidly (perhaps 2 or 3 a second) and paused to discuss every now and
then. Time restrictions on sessions were imposed only by participant schedules, with teacher sessions
ranging from 9 to 36 minutes and tutors from 17 to 48 minutes. The researcher took notes about the
images in relation to discussion, as for ethical reasons in school situations the images were not available
to the researchers later (Figures 2-7 are from a tutor’s lesson). Once the participants had gone through and
discussed the lesson together the researcher asked one or two further questions (time permitting) to clarify
points raised and about their experience of using the SenseCam. The review session was video recorded
for further analysis.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999549">
3.3 Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99985015">
Transcripts were produced of the talk around images for each of the recorded review sessions, and these
were then broken down into topic chunks defined as: a section of dialog that flowed naturally a round an
idea or a number of related ideas. If a new seemingly unrelated idea was then discussed, or there was a
long pause between comments that were not obviously linked, this was considered the beginning of a new
topic chunk. Chunks ranged in length from just a few words, to whole sentences, to multiple sentences
(some of the longest chunks were up to 300 words long). It is a subjective measure but an approach
adopted regularly by researchers in the field of teaches’ reflective practice as it makes most sense in terms
of understanding the data in terms of reflection (Hatton and Smith 1995; Manouchehri 2002; Ward and
McCotter 2004; Lee 2005; Davis 2006). Each chunk was then coded for evidence of reflection against a
framework synthesised from literature in the field of reflective practice in teaching, and from the initial
research that considered the role SenseCam images had in supporting teachers’ and tutors’ self-reflection
(Fleck 2008). Broadly this framework described: R0 – non reflective description; R1 – descriptive
reflection (involving some justification or reasons for action); and R2 – dialogic reflection (including
examples of questioning assumptions, referencing to past experiences, relating theory to practice,
interpreting, hypothesising, considering different explanations and implications of observations,
generalising from their experience) and higher levels of reflection that were not observed. Given the
presence of reflection, video and interview data were then interrogated to draw out the themes from each
case as to the role images played in conversation, and how this related to the reflection observed. In this
way an understanding of the role SenseCam images played in the support of social reflection was
developed.

4 Findings
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984">
The coding of the data against the reflection framework showed that reflection was taking place: whilst
much of the conversation could be considered as non-reflective description, in most cases more than half
of the conversation reached a level of at least R1 and in included chunks classified as R2 level reflection.
Such a balance of descriptive and reflective talk is in line with findings from other research (Hatton and
Smith 1995). Having established that reflection occurred, further analysis of these reflective chunks
showed that in these social reflection situations images were able to play various roles which we go onto
present here.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.961775">
4.1 Images support a return to experience
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999684111111111">
One clear role was in supporting participants returning to their lesson experience; this is the first step in
the process of reflection on experience as proposed by Boud et al. (1985) and Schön (1983). They were
able to do this both when all parties had been present during that original experience and when some had
been absent, though in different ways. For example, much discussion around images involved participants
establishing how the events of the lesson experience unfolded, with images acting as prompts or a
structure. As images were slightly distorted by the fish-eye lens, and in some cases not time-stamped,
establishing what was going on in the lesson from the images required some interpretation. This next
example is one in which two tutors, who taught the lesson together, build a shared memory of events,
allowing each to fill the other in on aspects they may have forgotten or even missed at the time:
</bodyText>
<tableCaption confidence="0.919243">
T10: and I’ve gone back, and what am I doing? I can’t remember why I went back to the board.
T11: you were...demonstrating something to...[?]
T10: is this when I actually gave an example?
T11: yes
T10: when I said, when I was, after I was talking to S?
T11: {yeah, yeah}
T10: {I said,} I’ll go up the front and I’ll give an example. So that’s what we were talking about here
T11: yeah.
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.82037075">
In this way the images helped both participants build a richer picture of what occurred during the lesson.
In cases where not all participants had been present during the initial lesson experience, building a shared
understanding of the lesson was even more necessary. This situation mostly arose when a trainee teacher
was reflecting with the support of their mentor who had not been present at the lesson. In these situations,
the teacher often described what was going on in the images, with their mentor prompting on occasion for
more detail. As the mentors were able to see to some extent what was going on by looking at the images
themselves, they would also often raise points that the teacher may not have thought to mention, as in the
next example:
M: so were they working in 4s? [looking at images]
P9: yeah 4s, two groups of 5 though because of the numbers and they were going to create their own
character
M: ok
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.900427">
4.2 Images prompt discussion of thoughts at the time
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9964915">
Participants were also prompted to fill in their discussant on their thoughts at the time. This was valuable
even when all participants had been present during the lesson, since such thoughts could not be observed
at the time. For example in this extract, the tutor, who was observing his peer tutoring, is prompted to
recall an observation he made whilst watching the lesson:

Similarly, an insight into what the trainee was thinking at the time is valuable to a mentor whether they
had been present in the lesson or not. In the next example, the mentor (who had not been present during
the lesson) prompts his trainee teacher to give more information as she goes through describing events
from the lesson. In doing so, he both understands more about what was going on in the lesson, and gains
access to her reasoning.

In addition to providing a more complete picture to all parties of all events that occurred at the time and
their thoughts about these, playing through the SenseCam images of the lesson also prompted a sharing
of background context. This included things like giving more information about particular students or
situations (as in the example below where P6 had previously worked with the class though P5 had not) or
the prompting of discussion of other related past experiences.

4.4 Images support reflective discussion

<bodyText confidence="0.99994325">
Most of the examples above describe ways in which the images prompted or triggered discussion.
However, participants also made more deliberate use of the images to support their ongoing reflective
discussions and to assist them in building up a shared understanding of the lesson context: by grounding,
illustrating and providing evidence throughout their discussions.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.494094">
4.4.1 Images ground conversation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992333388888889">
In most cases, the images were used to ‘ground’ the conversation at various points, i.e. to establish the
identity of a referent (Clark and Brennan 1991). They were used most often like this when participants
wished to say something about a particular student or group of students and in conversations about the
layout or seating plan of the room, and occurred whether or not all participants had been present at the
time of the lesson, e.g. (peer teachers both present during lesson):
T4: I don’t really engage everyone in talking. Like, there’s {this girl,} this girl [points]
T3: {there’s this girl that} [she also begins to point]
T3: but they talked
T4: they were talking, but {for example} these
T3: {what}
T3: this one
T4: yeah, the one at the end, she didn’t talk very much
Where one participant had not been present at the time, the images allowed the absent participant to see
patterns in students’ behaviour or recognize when the teacher was talking about the same student again,
even if they had no previous knowledge of the class or students. Though more occasionally, and in only a
few cases, one participant pointed out someone in the class in order to share some previous knowledge
about that particular student: i.e. in order to share background context as described earlier. For example in
this case, P3 had been teaching a class that she did not know well but the mentor did:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.37738">
M: B, the one that they were talking about in briefing, about being bullied today... [pointing]

4.4.2 Illustrating and providing evidence
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.881907272727273">
When self-reflecting with SenseCam images, participants had reported how the images often acted as
evidence to them of events in the lesson, in particular things they themselves had done. Although they
were often aware of this to some extent, somehow the evidence of the images made it more salient, and
prompted them to think more. In a similar way, images were used as evidence in social reflection
situations, supporting participants’ ongoing conversation by providing them with evidence to support or
illustrate what they were saying, or to provide evidence of points that had been made earlier in
discussion; e.g. in the next example, T2 backs up an earlier observation she had made about T3s teaching
being rushed at the end:
T2: so there you go, you rushed totally at the end, because that bit’s, there’s only even one picture
In some of the cases, participants looked for evidence in the images that either supported or offered an
alternate interpretation of what the other had said. This occurred most often when one participant had not
been present at the time of the lesson, as in this next example where the mentor questions P9s
interpretation of the images and offers an alternate explanation of events based on what they show:
P9: looks like there must be quite a lot of talking going on
M: can’t... oh I suppose there’s quite a few that are not, sort of not looking at you.
P9: No
M: but... I mean, you don’t know whether that’s just turn, turn back [does actions to indicate the teacher
turning away then back again] and you’ve just caught them in that particular time I suppose.
However, images could also be of value even when all participants were present during the experience, as
in this example, where, unusually, the teacher (P3) looks for evidence in the images to back up an
observation her mentor made during the lesson:
M: and there was no fidgeting or talking during the {plenary}

<note confidence="0.499091">
P3: no, and I’d say that girl who was quiet [points] was really listening

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.371482">
4.4.3 Images allow participants to see more
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.732655375">
Finally, as found when participants reflected alone with images, participants were often able to see things
in the images that they had either missed at the time or overlooked for reflection. Again, a number of
these observations were made from a series of images, and as a result participants often noticed patterns
in events from the images. For example the teacher in Case 18 made this observation about his use of
space in the room:
“oh look I haven’t got much movement, have I? I’m staying in that position quite a lot”
Interestingly, even in cases where one participant had not been in the class at the time of the lesson, the
absent participant was still able to point out such patterns from the images alone. In this example, the
mentor (who had been absent from the lesson) was able to encourage the teacher to reflect on the reasons
why this pattern – that she tended to spend more time with particular students than others – occurred:
M: ok [?] you were at this side weren’t you..
P8: yeah, see {but.. yeah}
M: {the actors} you’re not going over to the actors very much.
P8: no, not really.
M: is that because you’re more confident they know what they’re doing? {}Or is it because you think they
don’t need supervision as much because it’s...
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.83572925">
P8: {mmm} I think maybe the concern that play-dough, I mean I was first of all interested in play-dough
anyway because that was... even though the acting is communicative as well, it was obviously that was
what I was more interested in as well. But I think the play-dough’s got more room for the fact that they can
mess around.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.802265166666667">
M: yeah.
P8: acting’s very obvious if they’re messing around, whereas the play-dough, who knows where the play-
dough could have got to!
Patterns like this are things that it might be very difficult to notice without taking a ‘step back’ and
considering the lesson as a whole. In this way, the images were able to provide a quick temporal overview
of the lesson.

5 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998682">
Given the recognised value of video and still images for reflection, we were interested to see how a new
type of imaging technology, SenseCam, with its passively collected series of images, might support social
reflection for teachers/tutors. Coding of discussion chunks show that reflection clearly occurred in the
sessions. Further analysis of those chunks suggest that SenseCam images played a role in the discussions,
which were not unlike types of ‘phototalk’ already described in the literature in non-professional contexts
(Crabtree et al. 2004; Frohlich 2004; Lemon 2007) - for example, the images prompted teachers to
‘storytell’ events of the lesson to their absent mentors and, where participants were all present during the
recorded lesson, ‘chip in’ to decide what was going on in as they viewed them. However, what is of
particular interest here is whether this was of value in the present context – that of trainee teachers’ and
tutors’ social reflection.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.95217">
5.1 Supported features of reflective discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986675675676">
A comparison of the phototalk observed here with the kind of interactions described in the literature as
indicative of supported reflective practice suggests that answer is yes, the photos were of value. Firstly,
reflective discussion between mentors and trainee teachers is reported to provide an opportunity for the
mentor to structure a trainee’s reflection (Lee 2005), question their assumptions and interpretations of
events, and offer alternate ideas or explanations. In these cases, as with self-reflection, SenseCam images
played a role in structuring reflection, by supporting the trainee in explaining and taking their mentor
through the lesson (which the mentor had not always attended), and reminding them of events which may
otherwise have been forgotten or overlooked. In doing this, they were able to give their mentor an insight
into their thoughts, which a mentor could not access even when able to observe a lesson. Mentors are also
reported in the literature to share with trainee teachers’ their own experiences, and to direct attention to
incidents that a novice teacher may overlook (Lee 2005). In our cases of mentor-supported reflection, the
mentor often picked up on what the trainee teacher was saying about events, sometimes prompting for
more details or explanations as above, but also to make suggestions, from their own experience, for how
else events could be interpreted. Despite not having been in the lesson at the time, a mentor was able to
direct the teachers’ attention to issues they had failed to mention, and also to support them in seeing more
with the images – for example, by pointing out patterns of events. Often the images grounded, or
provided a shared reference point, for conversation. Mentors were also able to look for evidence from the
images which either supported what the teacher was saying, or suggested an alternate explanation could
be found.
Similarly, SenseCam images were able to support aspects of reflection between peer teachers and tutors
described by previous researchers. In addition to drawing each other’s attention to aspects of a lesson
overlooked from their own memory of events (Parry In submission), they supported each others’
observation and interpretation of events from images, and used images to ground their conversation, and
to provide evidence to illustrate or support any observations or interpretations they made either during the
lesson or whilst looking through images. In this way they were able to use the images to share their own
insights and experience with each other (Manouchehri 2002).Therefore, the phototalk observed between
mentors and teachers, and teacher and tutor peers, did include examples of the kind of interactions
described in the literature as indicative of supported reflective practice. Overall, the main role images
appeared to play was in supporting participants in developing a shared understanding of recorded lessons:
they took participants back through their lesson experience; supported and prompted them to share
experiences and thoughts; and allowed them to notice new things. This is similar to the role of video as
reported in previous research (Sherin and van Es 2002). As a result, this may have made new material
available for reflection. In terms of Schön’s idea of reflecting-on-action, this allowed participants to look
back on their practice experience and, with the support of their mentor or peers, become much more
aware of what was going on that time, including thinking about what actions or judgments were made and
why. It is hoped that over time, participants become more able to do this for themselves, and that this
thinking or reflection ultimately leads to a change for the better in their practice.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995113">
5.2 Reflecting on the value of SenseCam features for reflection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.962316036585366">
We have already highlighted, in motivating the choice of SenseCam, that the main advantage of
SenseCam over video as a tool to support teachers’ and tutors’ social reflection is its flexibility, making
many aspects of recording and reviewing lessons less problematic and less time consuming. This
flexibility did appeal to many participants and is discussed further in the next section. However, in
contrast to video, SenseCam only captures a series of still images without audio, and the quality of
images was often poor. Never-the-less the images were still able to play a role in the conversations
observed and we suggest that some of the perceived disadvantages of SenseCam may actually promote
reflection. Indeed, they have been described as doing so other research where SenseCam was worn in
everyday life. Certainly it is possible, likely even that the images do not capture everything (or even the
most important things) that occur during the lesson. However mentors did compare the SenseCam record
to the kind of record they might have made when observing a lesson:
“and I’d have scribbled down on a bit of paper, so it might be occasionally this time, this happens, but it
would be an incomplete record. Although, you know it obviously would be helped by being there and
being aware of what’s actually happening”
Also, in only providing a sample of the experience they may make certain aspects of it, that might
otherwise have been overlooked for reflection, more salient. For example participant 8 and her mentor
discuss below how images prompted them to focus on her physical positioning in the room, something
they have not considered before:
M: it was much more about the/your physical positioning in the room. That was really interesting, and
something that we never think about, do we normally {and}
P8: no
P8: a lot of the time it’s about what I’ve said or something, isn’t it? More verbal
M: yeah, especially as often when I’m observing, I’m not, you want to be slightly detached from it because
you don’t want to influence how a lesson’s going, so I’m often hiding in the cupboard or something like
that! So I can’t see where you are and that sort of thing
P8: {so it is the verbal}
M: {so I think the made} us think about that a lot.
A similar effect has been seen when SenseCam has been used to record everyday life: Harper et al. (Boud
et al.; 2007) talk about images presenting people events of their lives with a certain ‘strangeness’ by
foregrounding different aspects of their lives. In terms of reflection, this could lead to participants seeing
their experiences in a new light - or from a different perspective - to think differently about them as a
result (Davis 2006), and perhaps question their assumptions (Parsons and Stephenson 2005).
Another way that SenseCam images, as a series of still images, were able to get participants to see their
experience in a new light was by presenting them with a temporal overview of the lesson, as illustrated by
the examples in Section 4.4.3. In this way they could be considered to provide a different temporal
perspective on the lesson, which in turn allowed participants to notice certain patterns in their teaching
behaviour.
Harper also discusses how images are often able to remind participants of things not usually remembered
because they lack merit or are considered unimportant at the time (2007; 2008): the kind of mundane
aspects of life you would not usually choose to capture. They found that surprise in seeing the ‘mundane’
led people to reflect on and even consider changing their life. In the same way trainee teachers often have
difficulty knowing what is important to see in the classroom and learning to do this is one of the first
things a new reflective practitioner needs to learn, with support of their mentor or peers (Lindley et al.
2009). One mentor suggested a worn SenseCam, offering a first person perspective, might be valuable for
this reason:
“because they don&amp;apos;t see what&amp;apos;s going on quite as easily as you do when you&amp;apos;ve been teaching for a while,
because you notice things very quickly. Whereas they get so focussed in on their own personal
performance that they forget about the performance of the students at the same time. And this [meaning
SenseCam] would pick it up.”
Of course video might arguably be better for this purpose, if it were practical to use, as it could capture
more of what they might have forgotten and the duration of one lesson is more manageable than a whole
day of your life to record. However, such mundane aspects of experience are some of the first things
people attempt to not to capture with SenseCam in everyday life (Dillenbourg 1999) and may well be
skipped over during or edited out of video before reflective practice review sessions.
Lack of audio was another thing mentioned as a major drawback by a number of participants who felt it
would have allowed the teacher or tutor to think about what they were saying and how clear it was, and
also how the students responded. The mentor in Case 18 also suggested that audio would give a better
sense of exactly what was going on at any given point in the images, and so perhaps for someone who
was not there, audio would help to paint a richer picture. While this is worth exploring as part of future
work, it is also worth noting that previous reports of the use of video for reflective practice often
encountered poor audio quality so it is not clear the extent to which audio actually augments the images
for supporting reflective practice. Also it could be that having no audio makes it easier to discuss, as there
is no competing soundtrack over which to talk. Lindley (2009) describes how their participants reported
that the lack of sound accompanying SenseCam images ‘leaves space to think’, and Frohlich (2004)
reports that the addition of voiceovers to images seemed to inhibit discussion around them.
There was evidence too that the incomplete record of the lesson created by SenseCam highlighted the
possibility for multiple interpretations of events, as demonstrated in the examples above, especially those
in Section 4.4.2 where participants were able to question each others’ explanations of the images. In this
way the SenseCam record retains the need for negotiation between participants as to what happened at the
time, allowing the possibility of disagreement, which has been described as an essential part of effective
collaboration (Conati and Carenini 2001). In terms of reflection this could lead to reconsideration of
events and challenging of a teacher or tutors initial assumptions.
Similarly, this has been reported to lead to fear of misrepresentation when sharing images in studies of
SenseCam worn in everyday life (Lindley, 2009), and we observed this with a few teachers too. Mostly it
created a need for explanation, which in terms of reflection can benefit both parties: there is evidence to
suggest that explaining one’s understanding of a situation can promote learning as it reveals gaps in
knowledge (Thomson et al. 2005). Further, as discussed earlier, such explanations can allow a mentor
insight into the level of their trainee’s understanding which enables them to support and develop it
further. It can also offer insights into each other’s thoughts at the time, not otherwise available even if all
participants had been present during the lesson. Thus SenseCam may arguably afford a different shared
understanding of the lesson context than might be inspired either from watching the lesson first hand or
discussing around a video recording of it.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.963137">
5.3 Teacher suggestions for future SenseCam use
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99933843137255">
Throughout this research participants were keen to suggest ways in which SenseCam (or an improved
version) might fit into their existing reflective practices, and building on our insights above we will
highlight a few of these here.
In comparison to normal weekly mentor meetings, teacher participants suggested that discussions around
SenseCam images were more similar to the kind of reflective discussions they might have following a
lesson observation, where specific aspects of that lesson are discussed rather than more general aspects of
their teaching. We have highlighted throughout how images were able to play a role in reflective
discussions even where one participant was not present during the lesson experience. Also, in general,
participants who used SenseCams to support reflective discussion about a lesson where one participant
had observed that lesson (i.e. most tutor cases), were less enthusiastic about its value in that context.
Although there are a number of possible reasons for this, and examples of the images playing a role in
discussion even in these cases, these insights point to a more compelling role for SenseCam in recording
lessons where it is not possible for an observation to occur, often because of a lack of time:
“P10: We&amp;apos;ve done effectively in 1/2 hour what it would have - if you&amp;apos;d have sat in the classroom that&amp;apos;s an
hour, plus then 1/2 hour going through notes trying to remember what&amp;apos;s going on. You&amp;apos;ve got everything
there, you can just go through and pick up straight away”
This is more of an issue for newly and recently qualified teachers as they are observed less frequently,
and have an almost full teaching load preventing them observing others. In fact, participant 14, an NQT,
also gave SenseCam to a more senior teacher to record a lesson she was unable to observe in person, to
see how they managed with her students. Also, in situations where a teacher was struggling with
behavioural issues (one of the main reasons a newly or recently qualified teacher may have a non-routine
lesson observation), a number of participants (e.g. the mentor in case 25 below) felt a SenseCam
recording of a lesson would be preferable to an actual observation, not just because it would save time,
but because in situations the presence of the typically more senior observer would alter the dynamic in the
room:
“And it&amp;apos;s also really useful, because when I come into observe you, I can&amp;apos;t really help being there, and that
will change the dynamic, and ok, the camera probably has as well, but it&amp;apos;s just a different way of getting in
there and looking at it, which is really good”
We have also discussed that SenseCam images tended to make certain aspects of the lesson more salient.
Perhaps not surprisingly these were the more physical aspects of the lesson such as the student behaviour
and other classroom management issues just described; the teacher’s use of the room; the teacher’s ‘line
of sight’ or where they were looking; and the attention the teacher was giving to various groups of
students. Therefore many participants suggested these would be the aspects SenseCam would be most
suited to support reflection on, and they were certainly the aspects raised and talked about most
frequently. However, during the course of conversation a much wider variety of topics were also
discussed. This is very similar to the reported uses of video where the physical aspects of interaction
during teaching were discussed most often.
Related to this is the effect of location of SenseCam in the classroom. Participants expressed a desire to
capture images from different perspectives, for example giving one to a student to wear, or placing one in
the room somewhere to capture what went on ‘behind their backs’. As mentioned, we did place a second
SenseCam elsewhere in the room in a number of cases to begin exploring this issue. Although we can not
go into detail here about our findings from this, the most notable way in which this affected reflection
was in changing the focus of reflection; images captured by SenseCams placed in different locations
tended to foreground different aspects of the lesson (Fleck, 2008), with implications for what they may
then lead to reflection on.
Therefore, using SenseCam for this brief period of time inspired participants to consider ways in which
SenseCam may be incorporated into or extend their existing reflective practices. We have highlighted
especially the idea it may be of value where an external lesson observation is not possible due to time
restrictions or not desirable for the way it changes the classroom dynamic. Also images may be most
valuable for discussing physical aspects of teaching, and that different image perspectives can direct
reflective discussion in different directions.

5.4 Implications and further Research
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988523809524">
In summary, SenseCam images were found to be of value in supporting reflective discussion in the kind
of social settings which currently exist within the spheres of teacher and tutor training. The design
decisions which were made to enable it to be used as a lifelogging tool make it also flexible enough to
slot into the hectic schedules of these people. We have also discussed how features of the SenseCam
images may work to promote participants’ social reflection, and ways participants felt it might usefully be
incorporated into their practice.
The findings of this research were based on 16 case studies of teachers and tutors reflecting in social
situations around SenseCam image recordings of their lessons. In most of these cases, it was the first time
participants had used SenseCam. It would be of value in future research then to observe how participants
use of SenseCam and images develops over time as they become more familiar with it and explore
different ways of embedding it into their reflective practices. It would also be interesting to compare more
directly the reflective discussions which occur around video with those around SenseCam images. Given
the value of the images in the social reflection situations explored above, and insights from our
participants, there is also the potential for SenseCam images to support social reflection of trainee
teachers in other situations; for example, to support reflective discussion between peer trainee teachers
from different schools or in university tutorials. Similarly they could support university tutors discussions
when it has not been possible to observe each other’s teaching, and to support more experienced teachers,
tutors and lecturers where their time schedules do not allow much observation of each other. Further these
findings have wider implications application of SenseCam as a tool to support social reflection on
experience in other situations. It raises the idea that phototalk can be of value in work situations, and not
just a phenomena which occurs around domestic images.

<abstract confidence="0.999817625">As photographic technologies continue to develop, so too do the social practices surrounding their use. The focus of this paper is on the social practices surrounding images captured from a new photographic device – SenseCam – which, rather than capturing individual images when triggered by the user, automatically captures a series of images. This paper is concerned with the use of SenseCam digital images in social contexts where there is a professional purpose: supporting the collaborative reflective practices of school teachers and university tutors as part of their professional development. Analysis of video data collected from 16 in-situ case studies of reflective discussions show evidence that reflection took place as defined in the literature. Further, the phototalk around SenseCam images was found to benefit reflection in these social situations through promoting a rich shared understanding of the lesson context: supporting return to the experience, sharing of background context, grounding conversations, illustrating and providing evidence, and allowing people to see more. The paper concludes with a discussion on how different features of SenseCam images, such as variable quality, lack of audio, incompleteness, helped in this reflection or not. Finally implications from this work and participants comments are used to suggest ways in which SenseCam may be used in the future in teacher and tutors social reflection.</abstract>
