New wireless and sensor based technologies are
increasingly making their way into patients’ homes, e.g.
as self-care and assistive technology packages. The
drivers for this shift are indisputable when most
developed countries are dealing with an aging
population and rising healthcare costs. Apart from
shifting costs and the burden of care, it can also enable
people to take greater control of their health, including
the management of chronic diseases. The particular
concern of our Motivating Mobility project is with home-
based rehabilitation of upper arm movement for people
recovering from a stroke. The focus of this position
paper is to provide a general overview of the project

Strokes are one of the leading causes of severe adult
disability, limiting physical activity and affecting
independence and quality of life. There is growing
evidence that post-stroke rehabilitation exercises can
reduce disability [4] and increase independence.
Effective home-based regimes require repetitive
movements, done regularly and correctly as prescribed
by physiotherapists. However, these exercises may be
practiced incorrectly, and patients can find them
monotonous and frustrating. New sensing technologies
open up possibilities for interactive applications to help
motivate and support rehabilitation in the home.
The Motivating Mobility project is comprised of
physiotherapists, interaction designers, user experience
researchers, software engineers and electronics
engineers. The overall aim is to prototype devices
where patients can undertake repetitive movements
without necessarily thinking of them as exercises –
think here of being asked to swing your arm 500 times
compared to being asked to play a virtual game of
tennis where the arm swings are embedded into an
enjoyable experience. We aim to realise this through a
personalisable “plug and play” rehabilitation toolkit that
would facilitate the continuation of rehabilitation in the
home and where a physiotherapist, patient or carer can
match appropriate input devices that facilitate desired
movements, with motivating content.
To inform the overall approach we spent considerable
time understanding the experience of stroke patients,
their family/carers and their health professionals. We
interviewed people in their homes and in community-
based stroke clubs. We gave participants a range of
probes to complete to access the more intangible
aspects of stroke recovery. We also created a clinical
functional matrix mapping levels of ability against class
of activity (e.g., elbow/shoulder, grasp and release)
and the specific movements that a physiotherapist
might prescribe for a patient. The user case studies and
matrix were brought together into personas, prototype
storyboards and prototypes/toolkit components, which
we took to workshops with patients, carers and
therapists. We are currently working with four stroke
patients, developing specifically tailored applications
they can use at home [2]. We have deployed three of
these to date.

Elsewhere we have talked about the issues in designing
technologies to fit into the everyday spaces of the
homes of patients [1] as well as more general design
considerations [3]. Here, we wish to identify a few of
the challenges we faced in trying to support post-stoke
rehabilitation in the home.
The extended ‘user’ network:
Many discussions of healthcare applications implicitly
work with a model of ‘a patient’. Because stroke
patients live with disabilities that often require support
to meet even basic functional needs, their carers
and/or family members also become core participants
and indeed key enablers. The partners will often be the
ones who have to set up and manage any technology
we put into the home on a day-to-day basis, and for
specific exercise sessions. If the patient has
communication impairments from the stroke then their
partners will also need to assist with this.

<bodyText confidence="0.999697724637682">
Addressing the concerns and needs of this extended
notion of a ‘user’ to include the carer as core partner is
not without challenge. Interviews with carers/partners
indicated that they too went through significant lifestyle
changes as a result of their loved one’s stroke. Many
found this a difficult adjustment to make and all were,
naturally, keen to see their loved ones improve. Carers
were active partners in decision making concerning
rehabilitation practice. For example in one case, a
young mother, who had a stroke following surgery for a
brain tumour, was closely supported by her mother and
the mother was proactive in encouraging her daughter
to participate in our study. Another two of our female
participants were senior citizens with supportive
husbands. These men had to take on household and
other responsibilities that they had not ever undertaken
before the stroke. Stroke recovery, like bereavement
may be an incomplete and lengthy process with stages
of anger, denial and so on for both the person with
stroke and their carers. Wanting things to return as
they were is a natural desire but may be unrealistic and
views and attitudes vary over the course of
rehabilitation. It is a challenge then to recognise and
manage the agendas and concerns of all the
participants, while ensuring that the stroke patient’s
own wishes are respected.
The challenge of autonomy and motivation
Another key issue, and one that differentiates this type
of application from a rehabilitation system in a clinical
setting, is that of autonomy: this is the patient’s home
and they have the autonomy, and indeed the right, to
do as they want. In contrast it is common to hear
language such as ‘patient compliance’, which implies
that the clinician knows best and that the patient
should do what they are told. The motivations for this
are well-intentioned and easy to understand, e.g.,
when there is evidence that post-stroke function can be
recovered with repetitive exercise [3]. However, the
functional pay-off of repetitive exercise can take some
time. The patient can often be more motivated to do
the ‘wrong’ movement if it means a more immediate
‘good’ outcome, e.g., if they can get the cup of tea to
their mouth even if it means incorrectly lifting their
shoulder to do so. The issue of autonomy then also
requires us to re-think the role of the clinician, in this
case the physiotherapist, to be more of a partner and
expert facilitator. Growing interest in techniques such
as motivational interviewing suggest that this move is
already starting to happen.
Autonomy for the patient here is ‘dependent autonomy’
in reality. While the person with stroke has an
impairment that causes disability, the carer can be key
to how much of a handicap this is. The degree of
autonomy they experience then will be influenced by
the carer and this dependent relationship. As autonomy
is also recognised as an important component for
motivation, it is worth considering how our design
solutions engage and impact this relationship.
While a compliance ‘stick’ approach does not work in
the home setting, understanding how best to motivate
unique autonomous individuals through interactive
technology is non-trivial. The evidence for this becomes
all the more obvious when we are trying, on the one
hand, to develop a tool-kit approach that can be
scalable and flexible, and on the other hand trying to
develop applications for specific people. Even in our
four patients, we found huge diversity and resulting in
prototypes ranging from a book reader to a play toy
that can be used in collaboration with a child, to a

tangible chess game. Identifying the key functional
therapy movements and some candidate technology
components is only the beginning. The real challenge is
to design interactive content that engages, that will
evolve as the patient’s function returns or boredom
levels grow, and that can provide feedback in very
specific ways appropriate to the patient’s personality
and interests as well as clinical needs. Even ownership
of the feedback is an issue as therapists feel ownership
of information about exercises they provide; carers feel
responsibility for exercises carried out; and we see the
person with stroke as the primary stakeholder.
From concept to prototype... and what next?
A final challenge, just touched upon here, is the tension
inherent in working with real patients who have real
needs, yet also working with very early technology
prototypes and at a pre-clinical technology-trial stage.
We had frequent discussions in our project team arising
from our different disciplinary perspectives. The
interaction/HCI designers were thinking of the project
as a proof of technology concept that if successful
might go on to a pilot trial. Here success was more
about understanding what types of technologies might
have the potential to work in this setting. The clinicians
were more used to working with developed or at least
relatively stable technologies, even if at trial stage,
where real clinical trials can be undertaken and clinical
outcome measures matter. Negotiating these different
research stages and approaches is another challenge
for collaborative working. Similarly there are different
approaches to data collection and evaluation.
Finally is the question of what do we leave the patient
with at the end? We are not conducting a full clinical
trial and can only look for indicative measures that the
approach will work so the expectations of the patients
and carers need to be very carefully managed. If we
want to leave the technology with the patient after the
prototype study has been completed, there is then the
matter of how the maintenance and repair of early
prototypes are managed in the absence of continuing
resources. On the other hand taking the technology
away, having left it with the patient for three months
and having said it may help, is also very difficult to do.
Patients also expressed a frustration about helping out
with research and then not hearing about outcomes
after their involvement is finished. For many, their
study involvement is not just about being a participant
e.g., for a simple usability test. They want to be part of
making a difference for other stroke survivors.
Designing for rehabilitation at home is a complex multi-
stakeholder process.
