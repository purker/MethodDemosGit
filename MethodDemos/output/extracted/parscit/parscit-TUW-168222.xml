Abstract — Recent research results on communi-
cation science mention a relation between the inter-
locutor’s perceptional preferences, his or her men-
tal representations and his or her choice of expres-
sions. However, there is not any tool for analyzing
such.
In my research I combined lexical with computa-
tional linguistic methods to develop a software
prototype that is able to analyze text on the usage of
perceptional expressions. This analyzing tool can
help to identify the interlocutor’s perceptional pref-
erence for easier meeting his or her way of thinking
and thereby facilitate the understanding.

I. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961513513513">
All communication is based on perception. With the
establishment of constructivism the knowledge about
individual differences in perception spread. It seems
reasonable to assume that the individual form of
perception also influences the language of a person.
Interestingly, this theory hasn’t yet shown great af-
fects in the research on individual and personal lan-
guage use.
The Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP) offers a
model that seems as a first step in closing this gap:
The idea of sensual-specific perception which comes
noticeable in the individual language use is described
by the keyword “representational systems”. Accord-
ing to this, every person has one or two sensory sys-
tems preferably used to perceive his or her environ-
ment. From the five senses arises the classification in
visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory and gustatory
perception modalities. Each of these perception
classes forms a sensomotor complex, in the NLP
called representational system. As the inner represen-
tations are accessed for expressing thoughts, the
preferred sensory system of a speaker can be told by
his or her diction and wording.
The research about the optimization of communi-
cation furnished proof that the percentage of under-
standing is higher when a speaker adjusts his diction
to the diction of his addressee – what applies with a
high probability also to the use of perceptional
words.
Still, for the German language, not much research
on the relation between an individual’s perceptional
preference and his or her language use has been done
yet. To be able to go deeper into that idea, (1) a lexi-
cal corpus of perceptional expressions and (2) a
software tool that automatically filters those expres-
sions from a text are needed. Those two steps shall
be explained in this abstract.

II. A LEXICAL CORPUS OF PERCEPTIONAL
EXPRESSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979931034483">
For a systematic analysis of the use of perceptional
expressions, a corpus is needed, containing a collec-
tion of the most often used words and expressions
that can be directly linked to one of the perceptional
classes mentioned above. That corpus was built with
the input of 13 different resources and contains more
than 840 different entries with at least 200 words and
expressions per perceptional class. For further details
and the complete corpus see [1].
During the examination of the corpus it was found
that usually only the root word is decisive for the
assignment to a representational class, but that such a
root word can occur in different combinations. This
follows the fact that in the German language it is
possible to combine words and thereby create new
ones. That possibility causes a problem when search-
ing for a semantic unit that can also be part of a com-
pound word. For example, when searching for the
signal word “rot” [red], the output should also in-
clude words like “Morgenrot” [dawn] and “rotgrün”
[red and green] containing the same semantic root,
but not words like “Brot” [bread] or “Schrot”
[bruised grain] which include the same sequence of
characters, but have no semantic link to the searched
word. A search algorithm that also takes compound
words into account would especially be helpful when
scanning a German text for a list of signal words.
Therefore, a search algorithm using a new model
describing word composition was developed.

III. THE ANALYZING TOOL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971">
As a consequence of the multiple combining possi-
bilities of root words, an appropriate analyzing tool
should not only be able to find the expressions con-
tained by the corpus, but also all possible combina-
tions that are based on the same semantic root.
To solve this problem, a model of possible word
structures was developed. Following that model, it
can be determined which letters or syllables may
occur around a root word without changing its se-
mantic meaning (and hence the assignment to the
respective perceptional class). This model was intro-
duced with the aim to provide a clear description of
word composition transferable into an algorithm and,
based on the root word, describes the structure of
compound words as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9056685">
[ [prefix] + root word + [infix] + (word joint) ]
[prefix] + root word + [infix] + (ending)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969045454545">
The following notation was used: Round brackets
mark optional, but maximal single occurrence, square
brackets highlight optional (even multiple) occur-
rence of elements.
Based on the word components mentioned in the
Duden Grammatik [2], for each element of the model
a list of letter combinations was set up. The analyz-
ing tool joins the corpus of perceptional expressions
with the model of word structure and the lists of
possible word composition elements. After having
identified the searched sequence of characters in a
word, the algorithm analyzes the characters around it.
Step by step it checks whether the environment either
represents a semantically inseparable part of the
sequence of characters (which indicates a different
word meaning) or is the rest of a compound word
and thereby should be part of the output result.
The tests with the tool let presume that the occur-
rence of perceptional expression depends on the sort
of text and on the topic. A user’s test report on some
instant food i.e., had a very high rate of gustatory
vocabulary.

IV. FURTHER RESEARCH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904444444444">
At the moment I’m working on using this tool in user
modeling. As in the Internet (and esp. in blogs and
forums) there is quite a lot of text which can be di-
rectly linked to a user, this could be a rich source for
modeling the user’s mental representations of percep-
tional information. With such knowledge about the
user, advertisements with a higher acceptance can be
designed and chosen with respect to the user’s indi-
vidual perceptional preference.
