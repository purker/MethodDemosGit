        <p>As technology designers, we often inadvertently inscribe values and concepts in systems beyond what we intended. Further, while we aim to work from a userand use-centred perspective, we often miss the perspectives of other critical stakeholders and the broader context in which technology systems are to be used. Reflecting on issues of responsible innovation from the bottom up, this paper explores two exemplar cases: designing for older people and health care agendas, and designing for eco-behaviour change agendas. While very different in focus, both highlight the importance that different conceptualisations have on shaping possible solutions, and the challenge of identifying and negotiating competing agendas. This draws attention to the limits of both top-down and bottom-up perspectives and suggests instead a middle out approach to responsible design that considers both policy and practice aspects in the process. It also calls for us as responsible designers to be reflective practitioners aware of our power in inscribing possible futures.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        Human Computer Interaction (HCI) as a field is concerned with the design of
technologies from a user- and use-centred perspective, to ensure that
technologies are not only easy to use but are also useful, meet real needs and fit
into people’s everyday lives and practices. This is especially important as we
move from applications focused on the desktop and the workplace to
considering technologies embedded in everyday life. Technology is everywhere
now and touches on all spheres of life, not just for work and efficiency, but for
how we play, create, relate, socialise, and so on. As noted by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">Sellen et al.
(2009)</xref>
        , technology in this new pervasive and mobile world is fundamentally
shaping what it means to be human. As such, we are inscribing futures, intended
and unintended, through our technology design. This places a huge
responsibility on researchers and designers to design technologies in a
responsible way; this is a quantum step away from just designing elements of an
interface, and thinking about usability, to actually designing the broader
functionality and place of the technology in everyday lives and spaces.
      </p>
      <p>For this reason, I argue there is a convergence between more top-down
initiatives concerned with technology innovation policy, such as reflected in the
Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) initiative1, and more bottom-up
innovation and design/use approaches such as reflected in HCI2. Further, it can
be argued that it is not just a matter of convergence, but of recognising that we
cannot achieve either responsible innovation policy or responsible design
without the other. They are two sides of the same coin and reflect back to and
mutually shape and challenge each other. This calls for more of a middle-out
approach (to borrow from Coeira [2009]) in addressing responsible design.</p>
      <p>
        Elsewhere,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">Grimpe et al. (2014)</xref>
        have explored the relationship between RRI
and HCI, with a
“[...] wish to lay out what may be required to ‘naturalise’ the ambitious programme of
RRI within specific design activities and concerns in HCI, and [...] to provide some
elements to ‘talk back’ to the RRI discourse where necessary”
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Grimpe et al. 2014,
p.2966)</xref>
        This paper contributes to this discussion by exploring issues of responsible
design in two specific and different cases: designing for older people and health
care agendas, and designing for eco-behaviour change agendas. Both highlight
the importance that different conceptualisations have on shaping possible
solutions, and the challenge of identifying and negotiating competing agendas.
This draws attention to not only considering responsible design as a process, but
also considering the people in the process, arguing for responsible designers as
reflective practitioners aware of their power in inscribing possible futures.

      <p>How aging and healthcare are inscribed in technology is one area where
designers and policy makers etc. have particular power in shaping futures of
aging and care. Governments worldwide are facing significant challenges to
fund and deliver health care services, exacerbated by a rapidly aging population
and the associated increase in chronic diseases. Technology is seen as an

        Interestingly, around the same time of the 2014 Technology Assessment conference
(NTA6-TA14), where I (as an HCI person) gave a keynote speech,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">Grimpe et al. (2014)</xref>
        published a paper in the premier HCI conference, CHI’2014, exploring RRI in relation to
HCI.
important enabler for being able to meet this challenge, not only in the form of
national e-health initiatives focussed on institutional settings but more
particularly in the form of technologies to promote self care and care in the
community. Of concern in this paper are technologies variously labelled
telecare, telehealth, assistive technologies, and ambient assisted living (AAL),
all of which are targeted to enabling care at home. There is huge diversity in the
exact configuration of these systems, containing some mix of: monitoring safety
and security and/or activities of daily living (ADL) via sensors in the home, and
physiological monitoring with more of a clinical focus. Despite the very limited
evidence base for the effectiveness of such systems
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Brownsell et al. 2011)</xref>
        ,
governments and industry bodies have been committing huge resources over the
last years. Examples include the European AAL joint programme
(www.aaleurope.eu/), the National Health Service England programmes, the Whole
System Demonstrator (WSD) programme3, and the subsequent “3millionlives”
programme (www.3millionlives.co.uk ).
      </p>
      <p>
        The evidence base continues to be mixed and unclear. Evaluation studies
often focus on service delivery outcomes, in terms of reductions in emergency
admissions, bed days, costs, etc. (see, e.g.,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Henderson et al. (2013)</xref>
        re the WSD).
While these figures are often contended, they nonetheless point to an orientation
that neglects the practical impacts of the innovation for the people both
providing and receiving the service. Even if we accept the figures as presented
for the WSD, there are numerous other accounts that point to considerable
challenges in putting such systems to work, for both the care
organisations/clinicians and the people being cared for.
      </p>
      <p>
        First there is considerable work involved in integrating new technologies
both into organisational/regulatory structures and clinical work practices and
processes. Implementing telehealth entails much more than purchasing kit.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">Fitzsimmons et al. (2011)</xref>
        , for example, describe how they had to set up new
working arrangements (including policies, roles, processes, documents, etc.)
between a local authority and a health care agency, before they could even start
to run a randomised control trial (RCT) of telehealth for care of patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Once in use, the technology is
not just a simple addition to, or replacement of, existing practices. It takes
considerable time, effort and skill to integrate the technology into practice.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">Sharma and Clarke (2014)</xref>
        , for example, describe the ways in which nurses and
community workers found telehealth disruptive and threatening, and the long
lead time it took for them to start to work out the new roles and processes to
make use of it and to start to appreciate and realise some of its value.

      </p>
      <p>
        Both of these studies, and many more like them, point to the hidden
inscriptive implications of how we think about such technologies, how they can
be used, and how to evaluate them. By treating them as if they were similar to a
discrete stable intervention, such as a new medication, we ignore that they are
only tools to be adopted, adapted and integrated into very specific and situated
work contexts. This takes time and effort, as part of a complex socio-technical
process, for both technologies and practices to co-evolve – time and effort that is
not allowed for in an RCT model. In line with these critiques, a middle out
approach allows for both understanding impacts and outcomes, as well as
explicitly accounting for the co-evolutionary and iterative process of adoption
and the specificity of contexts in which outcomes are effortfully and particularly
achieved
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Pawson/Tilley 1997)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Of second (but not secondary) concern are the experiences of patients and
informal carers. In many evaluation studies, if patient perspectives are even
included, they are often dealt with summarily by some acceptance or health
outcome measure. Such a positivist view inadvertently reduces the person to
their managed condition and deletes the complexities of the patient experience
in realising value from these systems and how they are integrated into daily life.</p>
      <p>
        This experience is as complex and diverse as are people. Many accounts
point to issues such as: the messy reality of everyday homes and spaces
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref6">(e.g.
Axelrod et al. 2009)</xref>
        ; the importance of aesthetics and appearances in the home
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(e.g. Blythe et al. 2005)</xref>
        ; the threats to identity, independence and existing care
relationships
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20 ref8">(Sanders et al. 2012; Draper/Sorrell 2012)</xref>
        ; the disruption to life
and routines in the home
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref3">(e.g. Aarhus/Ballegaard 2010; Balaam et al. 2011)</xref>
        ; and
significant work of family members and informal carers to support the practical
“bricolage” needed to adapt technologies to the setting
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Procter et al. 2014)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Much current rhetoric about telehealth/telecare/AAL also does not allow for
different experiences or wishes and presumes an ability and willingness on the
part of patients, and their carers, to actively engage in disease management and
health monitoring or to stay at home. This is not always the case
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16 ref20">(Holstein/Minkler 2003; Sanders et al. 2012)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Another consequence of how we conceptualise such systems is that quality
of life is inadvertently reduced to an absence of adverse health events or a graph
produced by a Bayesian algorithm, determined by a technical sensing of
“activities of daily living” (ADL). “Aging” becomes inscribed then as a
managed health problem, isolated within the four walls of the home. It ignores
the richness of living rather than just “aging”, the importance for cognitively
able older people to contribute as well as receive, to have relationships, to be
active as they wish, and to make positive adaptations to maintain a quality of life
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref23">(Lindley et al. 2008; Tornstam 2005)</xref>
        . In
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">Fitzpatrick et al. (2015)</xref>
        , we argue for a
re-imagination of these AAL and telecare agendas and designing for agency,
adaptivity and reciprocity alongside support for specific health needs.

      <title>Responsible sustainability: food waste</title>
      <p>The issue of sustainability and how to reduce consumption and be more
ecologically sustainable is also a topic gaining much current
governmental/policy attention, and technology is seen as an enabler (e.g. as
evidenced by smart energy monitoring). Again, “how we think” matters for how
we approach the issues to be addressed, what we design and for whom, and what
we evaluate.</p>
      <p>In many technology approaches, e.g. as evidenced in the many “apps” for
mobile devices, there is an implicit assumption about the rational individual
who, given access to the right figures, will make adjustments and change
behaviour. This stance is captured in the popular language of “persuasive
technologies” and “motivation and behaviour change”. However, such a stance
hides the complex negotiations that people make among all aspects of their life
(everyday practices) and the ways in which the broader social, political, cultural
contexts shape possibilities for action.</p>
      <p>
        This can be illustrated in the issue of reducing food waste, where one third
to one half of food in industrialised countries ends up wasted. As 46 % of this
waste is said to happen at the consumer level
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Gustavsson et al. 2011)</xref>
        , it is
reasonable to assume that technologies targeting individual consumers and
households will encourage them to reduce waste. However, the issues entailed in
food being wasted are not straightforward.
      </p>
      <p>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref12">Ganglbauer (2014)</xref>
        conducted in-depth research in homes to understand the
reality of practices behind the consumer food waste figures. A common theme
across all participants was that no one wanted to, or intended to, waste food but
all did waste food and most felt considerable guilt about it. Her research points
to food waste as a final action resulting from complex negotiations among many
other actions, values, concerns, and constraints that are part of managing
everyday life. Examples include: people prioritising concerns for managing tight
budgets and being swayed by the seduction of special offers and big packages in
the supermarket, but then ending up buying more than they can use; or people
buying food in well planned ways, but then having unexpected opportunities to
go out and socialise with friends instead of cooking the food in the fridge, thus
prioritising having a social life over the potential for food waste; or people being
very busy and not coordinating with others in the household and so double buy
food; and so on
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(see Ganglbauer et al. [2013] for detailed discussion)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        This suggests very different ways of approaching the design of technology
support for food waste, e.g. to soften the stance of “motivation/persuasion” to
one, for example, of supporting awareness and reflection on previous choices
that might have led to waste
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref12">(see the food waste diary and fridge cam
discussions in Ganglbauer 2014)</xref>
        . Technology design/designers can also
recognise the opportunities for supporting communities wanting to share food
(ibid.) and fostering broader cultural change and political activism, for example
to lobby for changes in supermarket practices.

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In both the aging/care and the food waste cases, traditional rational technology
approaches are increasingly being challenged by the complex realities of
everyday life in which these technologies have to be put to work. Neither a
topdown approach, driven by governmental/policy agendas, nor a bottom-up
approach that focuses on the individual is creating technologies that really work.
Further, the technologies that we design implicitly embody and inscribe notions
that we as designers and evaluators hold: It matters how we conceptualise the
problem space, what we design and for whom, and what we count and account
for in our evaluations.</p>
      <p>This puts a responsibility on us as designers/evaluators of technologies to be
reflective about our own practices and the sorts of futures we are inscribing,
implicitly or otherwise. As part of this, it is timely to consider what it might
mean to take a middle-out approach. This entails delivering technologies to
address very real societal challenges (e.g. around managing care of an aging
population or reducing waste) and recognising that outcome/impact measures
are still important for prioritising governmental resources; it also entails a
recognition of the practical realities of putting technologies to work in very
specific contexts, negotiating the needs and indeed skills of various
participants/stakeholders, the diverse everyday practices and concerns, and that
it is all part of an ongoing co-evolutionary process of adoption and adaptation.
