      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>
        We participated in challenge 1 of the Social Event
Detection (SED) task [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ]. The goal of the task is to build
photo clusters belonging to unique social events in a large
collection of tagged flicker images. Thereby the total
number of events is not provided. In an additional subtask we
assign unlabeled videos to the previously discovered photo
clusters. The development set comprises 300k images from
14882 unique events. For the test set of 131k images no
ground truth is available.
      </p>
      <p>We consider challenge 1 as an unsupervised data mining
task. The basic idea is to rely on robust heuristics and
to reduce the number of parameters of the approach to a
minimum to obtain a good generalization ability between
different datasets. Additionally, the proposed approach does
not require any external (online) data sources.</p>
      <p>In the course of the SED2013 task, we focus on the
following research questions: (i) Which level of clustering
performance can be obtained by relying on simple but robust
heuristics for unsupervised clustering and how do the results
compare to more complex clustering methods? (ii) How well
does the proposed approach generalize to unknown data?</p>

      <title>RELATED WORK</title>
      <p>
        Many existing approaches for event detection in image
collections require a separate training [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref3">1, 3</xref>
        ]. Becker et al.
create separate clusters for each feature such as title,
description, time, etc. The authors employ single-pass incremental
clustering whereas the threshold for each cluster is tuned
based on a set of training data [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ]. Reuter and Cimiano
employ machine learning techniques to detect events in social
streams. The authors employ SVMs to classify Flickr images
annotated by machine tags from last.fm into events [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        Vavliakis et al. propose a social event detection approach
based on topic detection [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ]. The authors perform topic
detection by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for each city
in the image collection. Additionally, the authors manually
identify topics that are typical for a specific event cluster.
      </p>
      <p>From related approaches we observe that many
assumptions are made on the training set and (partially manual)
optimizations are required which limits general
applicability. Our unsupervised approach minimizes the assumptions
on the data and avoids manual intervention. The approach
exhibits a strong generalization ability and results show that
the sensitivity to the involved parameters is reasonably low.

    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>Full Clustering</title>
      <p>The input to the approach are the available metadata of
the SED dataset (capture data, location, title, tags,
description) and a stopword list. No other data sources are
required. In a first step, the metadata are preprocessed: Since
a user cannot be at two locations at the same time, we
assign locations of photos taken by the same user at the same
time to the user’s non-geotagged photos. Additionally, the
textual metadata are filtered by the stopword list.</p>
      <p>In a next step, we perform three independent
clusterings in parallel: temporal clustering, location clustering, and
topic clustering. For temporal clustering we employ
meanshift and set the bandwidth parameter βT in a way that
the resulting clusters span between 2 and 6 hours, which is
a reasonable temporal resolution for social events. For
location clustering we observe that the performance gain of
meanshift clustering does not justify the computational
efforts. Hence, we skip meanshift clustering and assign each
individual and unique location in the data a separate cluster
ID. Topic clustering is based on topic extraction by LDA.
We perform topic modeling on the textual descriptions of
each photo (title, tags, description) using LDA and extract
T topics for the employed dataset. For each photo i, we
estimate the likelihoods li,1 and li,2 of the first- and
secondbest matching topics. If the difference of the likelihoods is
larger than a threshold τ (li,1 − li,2 &gt; τ ) the most likely
topic is assigned to the photo otherwise no topic is assigned.
Parameter τ is set to 0.3 for all experiments.</p>
      <p>The three independent clusterings are the basis for the
generation of initial event clusters. Photos which share the
same temporal cluster, location cluster, and topic cluster
are assigned the same unique event ID. The remaining
photos are assigned to existing and new events in a number
of matching steps. First, remaining photos which share

the same user and capture time as photos in already
existing events are assigned to the respective events. If
several events share the same users and capture times, the
events are merged. Second, remaining photos without
location information are matched to existing events by time and
topic. If no match to an existing event can be established, a
new (non-geotagged event cluster) is generated. For photos
where no location and no topic is available we generate new
events by their capture time.</p>
      <p>The resulting sets of events (refined event clusters and
non-geotagged event clusters) may oversegment the true event
distribution. Hence, we merge events that share similar
time, location, and topic to obtain the final event clusters.

      <title>Full Clustering of Media using Videos</title>
      <p>For the video subtask, we apply the above described topic
modeling to the stopword-filtered textual descriptions of the
videos (title, description, keywords). Temporal clustering
and location clustering are neglected, because most videos
do not contain location information and a capturing date.
As a consequence, parameter τ is set to 0.0 for all
experiments to achieve a complete clustering of all videos.</p>
      <p>We investigate three different approaches for generating
the video clusters: (i) LDA is applied to train a topic model
with 200 topics on the development data from which the
topics of the test data are derived; (ii) each video constitutes
a topic on its own; and (iii) an unsupervised LDA-based
approach is used to detect 70 topics in the test data. After
the video clusters are created, we link them to the previously
generated photo clusters. The keywords of video clusters
V are compared to the keywords of the photo clusters P
using the Jaccard similarity coefficient. Each video cluster
is linked to the photo cluster with the highest similarity.</p>

      <title>EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS</title>
      <p>
        We use the same parameters for experiments on the
development and test set. To estimate the numbers of topics,
we assume that each topic is constituted in average by
100200 photos. Additionally, we evaluate different values of βT
corresponding to an event duration of 2-6 hours. The results
of the proposed approach for both sets demonstrate its
excellent generalization ability (see Table 1). Results for the
test set are even better than for the development set. The
clustering performance is comparable to (more complex)
supervised state-of-the-art methods. The approach by Petkos
et al., for example, yields NMI values of 0.92 (average of best
results) and 0.69 (average performance) on a portion of the
SED2011 dataset (no F1 reported) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ]. Becker et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ] yield
NMI values between 0.92 and 0.94 and F1 values from 0.77
to 0.82 on a test set consisting of 270k photos (10 splits).
Reuter and Cimiano report an F1 of 0.74 for a dataset of
700k photos (7 splits, no NMI reported) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ].

      <p>The three approaches submitted to the video subtask show
different results. The supervised approach trained on the
development data performs suboptimally (F1=0.42, NMI=0.68).
The reason for this may be that the events of the test data
are inferred from the events in the development data. If an
event is not included in the development data, it cannot be
inferred. The second approach shows that comparing the
metadata of single videos with the accumulated LDA
keywords from clusters is not well-suited to link single videos
to clusters (F1=0.34, NMI=0.77). The unsupervised
LDAbased approach performs best (F1=0.69, NMI=0.85) and
builds a promising baseline for future improvements.
