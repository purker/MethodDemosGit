        <p>* The need to provide more holistic adaptivity to students has brought us to investigate the relationship between learning styles and working memory capacity (WMC). The aim of this investigation is to study the relationship between learning styles and WMC in order to get additional information about the students. This information can be used to make more holistic adaptivity possible by improving the student modelling process of both learning styles and WMC. An experiment with 297 participants was conducted. Findings suggest that relationships from WMC to the active/reflective, the sensing/intuitive, and the visual/verbal learning styles exist, whereas the suggested relationship from WMC to sequential/global learning styles could not be found.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Providing courses that fit the needs of learners
makes learning easier for students. In recent years,
researchers focused on the impact of individual
characteristics such as learning styles and cognitive
traits in technology enhanced learning and how such
differences can be incorporated in order to provide
adaptive courses.</p>
      <p>
        To be able to provide proper adaptivity, the needs of
students have to be known first. With respect to
technology enhanced learning, Brusilovsky [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ]
distinguished between two different ways for getting
information about the learners’ needs: the
collaborative and the automatic student modelling
approach. In the former, the students explicitly provide
information about themselves (e.g. filling out a
* This research has been funded partly by the Austrian Federal
Ministry for Education, Science, and Culture, the European Social
Fund (ESF) under grant 31.963/46-VII/9/2002.
questionnaire), whereas in the latter, the system infers
the needs from the behaviour and actions of the
students automatically while they are working/learning
in the system. The automatic approach is direct and is
free from the problem of inaccurate self-conceptions of
students. However, a problem with the automatic
approach is to get enough reliable information to build
a robust student model. As a solution, Brusilovsky [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ]
recommended the use of additional sources of
information. Hence, it is beneficial to find mechanisms
that use whatever information about the learner is
already available to get as much reliable information to
build a more robust student model.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this paper, we investigate the relationship
between learning styles, in particular the
FelderSilverman learning style model (FSLSM) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ], and
working memory capacity (WMC). WMC is one of the
cognitive traits included in the Cognitive Trait Model
(CTM) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3 ref4">3, 4</xref>
        ], a model to profile students’ cognitive
traits using student behaviour. The found relationship
can then be used to strengthen the inference procedure
of student models such as the CTM by including
additional information from learning styles. Similarly,
the findings can also be used to strength a learning
style model which is built not from a questionnaire but
from student behaviour observations.
      </p>
      <p>Section 2 presents a brief introduction to FSLSM
and WMC. It also lists a set of hypotheses based on our
previous literature study. Section 3 describes the study
design and Section 4 presents the method used in the
experiment. The results are discussed in Section 5 and
Section 6 concludes this study.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>2. Background</title>
      <p>
        Several different learning style models exist in the
literature. Looking at adaptive educational systems
which incorporate learning styles, FSLSM is one of the
most often used model in recent times and some
researchers even argue that it is the most appropriate
model [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5 ref6">5, 6</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>According to FSLSM, each learner is characterized
according to four dimensions: active learners learn by
trying things out and working with others, whereas
reflective learners learn by thinking things through and
working alone. Sensing learners like to learn concrete
material and tend to be practical, whereas intuitive
learners prefer to learn abstract material such as
theories and their meanings and tend to be more
innovative than sensing learners. Visual learners
remember best what they have seen, whereas verbal
learners get more out of words, regardless whether they
are spoken or written. Sequential learners learn in
linear steps and prefer to follow linear stepwise paths,
whereas global learners learn in large leaps and are
characterized as holistic.</p>
      <p>
        Regarding cognitive traits, working memory
capacity is an important factor for learning. In earlier
times, working memory was also referred to as
shortterm memory. Richards-Ward [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ] named it the
ShortTerm Store (STS) to emphasise its role of temporal
storage of recently perceived information. Working
memory allows us to keep active a limited amount of
information (roughly 7+-2 items) for a brief period of
time [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ]. WMC is included in the Cognitive Trait
Model [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3 ref4">3, 4</xref>
        ], a student model that aims at profiling
learners according to their cognitive traits in adaptive
web-based educational systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        A comprehensive literature review [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ] investigated
the relationship of FSLSM and WMC by looking at
studies that deal with the interaction of learning styles,
cognitive styles, and cognitive traits. From these
studies, direct and indirect relationships between the
dimensions of FSLSM and WMC were concluded. As
a result from the literature review, it can be
summarized that learners with high WMC tend to
prefer a reflective, intuitive, and sequential learning
style. On the other hand, learners with a low WMC
tend to have a more active, sensing, and global learning
style. For the visual/verbal dimension, it was identified
only an one-directional relationship rather than a
bidirectional correlation as for the other dimensions.
Therefore, learners with a low WMC tend to prefer a
visual learning style but learners with a high WMC
might have visual or verbal preferences. On the other
hand, learners with a verbal learning style tend to have
a high WMC but learners with a visual learning style
might have a high or low WMC.
      </p>

      <title>3. Materials</title>
      <p>The aim of this study is to analyse the relationship
between working memory capacity and learning styles
by the use of real data and compare it with the results
from the literature review. Therefore, we conducted an
experiment with 297 students from Vienna University
of Technology in Austria. All students were asked to
fill out a questionnaire for identifying their learning
styles and perform a test to detect their WMC.</p>
      <p>
        In order to identify learning styles, we used the
Index of Learning Styles questionnaire (ILS) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ],
which is developed to detect learning styles based on
the FSLSM. The ILS is an often used instrument and
consists of 44 questions which can be answered online.
As mentioned earlier, according to FSLSM each
learner has a personal preference for each of the four
dimensions. In ILS, these preferences are expressed
with values between +11 to -11 per dimension, where
for instance +11 indicates a strong active preference
and -11 a strong reflective preference.
      </p>
      <p>
        For detecting WMC, we developed Web-OSPAN
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ]. Web-OSPAN is a web-based version of the
operation word span task (OSPAN) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
        ]. According to
De Neys et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
        ], the operation word span task has
become one of the most popular tasks to measure
WMC. In the task, subjects are required to perform
simple arithmetical operations such as (2 * 3) + 4 = 10
and answer whether this operation is true or false.
After each operation, a word is presented. The subjects
are asked to perform 2-6 arithmetic operations and at
the end are asked to recall the words presented after
each operation in the correct order. As proposed by
Turner and Engle [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
        ], the total number of correct
calculations (referred to as process measure, ranged
from 0-60), the total number of correct recalled words
(referred to as WMC values, ranged from 0-60), the
maximum set size the subject had the words recalled
correctly (referred to as set size memory span, ranged
from 0-6), and the mean response latency are recorded
and the total number of correctly recalled words is used
as a measure of WMC. Web-OSPAN follows OSPAN
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
        ] in recording these measures. Additionally,
WebOSPAN records a partial correct memory span (ranged
from 0-60), which counts words as correct even when
the order of words is not correct.
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>4. Method for statistical data analysis</title>
      <p>Data of students who had more than 15 mistakes in
the calculations of Web-OSPAN or spent less than 5
minutes in ILS were discarded because they do not
meet the experiment requirements. Data from 225
students were finally used for analyses.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we improved the reliability of ILS
(measured by Cronbach’s alpha) through removing
weak reliable questions (1 from the active/reflective
dimension, 1 from the sensing/intuitive dimension, 3
from the visual/verbal dimension, and 2 from the
sequential/global dimension).</p>
      <p>Data analysis was done by a general and an in-depth
analysis. In both, outliers were excluded for the
analysed dimension. General analysis dealt with
correlation analysis between WMC and ILS
dimensions by using rank correlation. Additionally, we
analysed the recorded measures gathered from
WebOSPAN by correlating them with the WMC values in
order to show how significant they are related to
WMC. According to the structure of analysed values,
Pearson’s correlation or rank correlation was applied.</p>
      <p>
        For the in-depth analysis, learning style values were
divided into three groups, distinguishing e.g. between
an active, balanced, and reflective preference. The
groups were built based on recommendations by Felder
and colleagues [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref14">10, 14</xref>
        ] and with respect to the
performed reduction of questions for increasing
reliability. Consequently, values &gt;= +4 indicate a
preference for one pole, values &lt;= - 4 indicate a
preference for the other pole and values between +3
and -3 indicate a balanced learning style.
      </p>
      <p>Then, chi-square test was used to identify
differences between the groups. If significant
differences were detected, further analyses were
performed to identify the kind of relation between the
groups. These further analyses included correlation
analysis between WMC values and the absolute values
of ILS in order to identify a correlation between WMC
and the strength of preference. Moreover, we split the
dataset into two sub-datasets Sx and Sy in in-depth
analysis. Sx covers only data representing a balanced
preference or a preference for the positive pole, and Sy
covers only data with an ILS value representing a
balanced preference or a preference of the negative
pole. For each sub-dataset, correlation analysis and
group comparison methods (grouping WMC values
and grouping learning style values) were performed.</p>
      <p>
        For the visual/verbal dimension, literature [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ]
argued for a one-directional rather than a bidirectional
relationship. In order to prove one-directional
relationships, we separated data into two sub-datasets
Fx and Fy, where Fx includes only data from verbal
learners and Fy includes only data from visual learners.
Then, for each sub-dataset, the number of learners in
WMC groups (grouped by steps of 5) was calculated
and rank correlation analysis was performed in order to
find a correlation between the frequencies of learners
with e.g. verbal learning style (Fx) and their WMC.
Afterwards, results for Fx and Fy were compared. The
same was done for the two sub-datasets including
learners with only high and only low WMC. Due to the
high difference in variance in the variables, Kendall’s
tau can be considered as more robust and is therefore
applied for these analyses.

      <title>5. Results</title>
      <p>In the following subsections, we introduce and
discuss the results of the conduced analyses for the
measures of Web-OSPAN as well as for each learning
style dimension.</p>
      <sec id="sec-5-1">
        <title>5.1. Measures of Web-OSPAN</title>
        <p>The conducted correlation analysis, calculated by
Pearson’s r, Kendall’s tau or Spearman’s rho
respectively, shows that all other measures gathered
from Web-OSPAN are highly significant (p&lt;0.001)
correlated with the WMC values. The set size memory
span (tau=0.649, rho=0.757) and the partial correct
memory span (tau=0.741, rho=0.883) show a strong
positive correlation to the WMC values. Interesting is
that the mean response time is negative correlated
(r=-0.361), which indicates that learners who answered
quickly answered correctly more often. The values of
the process measure show only a low positive
correlation (tau=0.191, rho=0.258).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-5-2">
        <title>5.2. Active/reflective dimension</title>
        <p>In the general analysis, no significant correlations
were found between WMC and the active/reflective
values. However, according to the in-depth analysis,
the significant result of the chi-square test (χ2=7.889,
p=0.019) indicated that the three groups (active,
balanced, and reflective) were different to each other.
We found a highly significant negative correlation
between the absolute active/reflective values and the
WMC values (tau=-0.169, p=0.001; rho=-0.222,
p=0.001), the set size memory span (tau=-0.140,
p=0.015; rho=-0.161, p=0.015), and the partial correct
memory span (tau=-0.167, p=0.002; rho=-0.216,
0.003). These correlations show that learners with a
balanced learning style tend to have high WMC,
whereas learners with either a very active or a very
reflective learning style tend to have low WMC. This
hypothesis is furthermore supported by the result of the
analysis of the sub-dataset Sact/bal and Sref/bal.</p>
        <p>Looking at the sub-dataset Sact/bal, which includes
only data indicating an active or balanced preference,
the correlation analysis resulted in a negative
significant correlation between the active/balanced
values and WMC values (tau=-0.173, p=0.002;
rho=-0.226, p=0.003), set size memory span
(tau=-0.162, p=0.014; rho=-0.191, p=0.013), partial
correct memory span (tau=-0.142, p=0.022;
rho=-0.188, p=0.023), and process measure
(tau=-0.138, p=0.019; rho=-0.177, p=0.021). These
correlations show that active learners tend to have low
WMC and balanced learners tend to have high WMC
(and vice versa). This is further supported by a
significant result of the Mann-Whitney U test
(U=2324.5, p=0.008), comparing the high WMC group
and low WMC group over the active/balanced values
and indicating that learners with low WMC have a
significantly more active learning style than learners
with high WMC.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, looking at Sref/bal, the
reflective/balanced part of data, we found only a low
significant, positive correlation between the WMC
values and the reflective/balanced values according to
Spearman’s rho (rho=0.163, p=0.045). However, this
relation is supported by the highly significant result of
the t-test (T=-3.094, p=0.002), comparing the reflective
and balanced group over the WMC values and
indicating that reflective learners have significantly
lower WMC than balanced learners.</p>
        <p>
          From all these evidences, we can conclude that
there exists a significant relationship between the
active/reflective dimension and WMC. This
relationship shows that the more balanced the learning
style is, the higher WMC the learners tend to have. On
the other hand, the stronger the preference for either an
active or a reflective learning style is, the lower WMC
the learners tend to have. Regarding an active learning
preference, our results are in agreement with the
conclusions from literature [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
          ], since both associate
low WMC with an active learning preference.
However, regarding a reflective preference,
conclusions from literature argued for high WMC.
According to our results, active and reflective
preferences are associated with low WMC, whereas a
balanced learning style is related to high WMC.
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-5-3">
        <title>5.3. Sensing/intuitive dimension</title>
        <p>The results of the correlation analysis of the
sensing/intuitive and WMC values show a significant
negative correlation between sensing/intuitive values
and the size set memory span (tau=-0.113, p=0.046;
rho=-0.137, p=0.045). This result gives an indication
for an indirect relationship between WMC and the
sensing/intuitive dimension since the WMC values are
highly correlated with the size set memory span (as
shown in Section 5.1.). The results of the chi-square
test (χ2=8.628, p=0.013) show that the three groups
(sensing, balanced, intuitive) are significantly different
from each other. Since the correlation of WMC values
and absolute sensing/intuitive values is not significant,
this is another indication for a linear correlation
between a sensing/intuitive preference and WMC.</p>
        <p>Looking at the sub-dataset Ssen/bal, we found a
significant negative correlation between the
sensing/balanced values and the set size memory span
(tau=-0.132, p=0.041; rho=-0.157, p=0.041), which
again indicates an indirect relation to WMC.
Accordingly, low WMC is associated with a sensing
learning style and high WMC is associated with a
balanced learning style. This is also supported by the
results of the group comparison in both directions. The
highly significant result (U=2263, p=0.005) from the
Mann-Whitney U test between groups of WMC shows
that learners with low WMC tend to have a
significantly higher preference for a sensing learning
style than learners with high WMC. Looking in the
other direction, the conducted t-test (T=-1.976, p&lt;0.05)
shows that learners with a sensing learning style tend
to have significantly lower WMC than learners with a
balanced learning style.</p>
        <p>Considering the intuitive/balanced part, we found
only a low, negative correlation between the
intuitive/balanced values and the mean response
latency (tau=-0.149, p=0.032; rho=-0.205, p=0.029).
According to the analysis in Section 5.1., only a weak
correlation exists between the WMC values and the
mean response latency, which seems to be not reliable
enough to conclude for an indirect relationship. Also
from group comparison, no significant relations were
found.</p>
        <p>
          From these results, we can conclude that a sensing
learning style is associated with low WMC and the
more balanced the learning style becomes, the higher is
the tendency to have high WMC. This is in agreement
with the conclusions from literature [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
          ]. Furthermore,
according to literature this increase of tendency for
high WMC continues, the more intuitive the learning
style preference becomes. For this second part of the
relationship, we found no evidence in the data. This
might be reasoned from the few learners with strong
intuitive preference (ILS value &lt;= - 8, n=7).

        <title>5.4. Visual/verbal dimension</title>
        <p>
          As indicated by the literature review [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
          ], we did not
find any significant result for a bidirectional
relationship between WMC and the visual/verbal
dimension, neither with general analysis nor with
indepth analysis. Since according to literature an
onedirectional relationship was detected, we focused on
proving one-directional relationships by using
correlation of frequencies in sub-datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at two datasets separating learners with
high and low WMC, correlation between frequencies
and visual/verbal preferences shows a highly
significant and strong positive correlation for both, low
WMC learners (tau=0.857, p=0.002) and high WMC
learners (tau=0.889, p=0.001). This was expected since
it is know from other studies, summarized in [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
          ], and
can also be seen from our study that, in general, more
learners have a visual than a verbal learning style.
        </p>
        <p>When separating learners with visual and verbal
learning preference, correlation analysis of frequencies
shows a significant correlation for learners with a
verbal learning style (tau=0.51, p=0.033). This
indicates that in the group of verbal learners, a high
frequency is associated with high WMC, whereas few
verbal learners have low WMC. In contrast, when
looking at learners with a visual style, the result of the
correlation is not significant and correlation is lower
than for the verbal learners (tau=0.455, p=0.520).</p>
        <p>
          As a conclusion, our findings are in agreement with
the results from the literature review [

          According to literature, evidence exists for a
relationship between a sequential learning style
preference and high WMC as well as a global learning
style preference and low WMC [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
          ]. Based on the data
of this study, we did not find any evidence that yields
to this conclusion. Neither general analysis nor
indepth analysis resulted in a significant relationship.
Therefore, our findings are in disagreement with
literature, by indicating that there exists no relationship
between the sequential/global dimension and WMC.

      <title>6. Conclusion and future work</title>
      <p>In this paper, we investigated the relationship
between the FSLSM and WMC by conducting an
experiment with 297 participants. The results showed a
relationship for the active/reflective, the
sensing/intuitive, and the visual/verbal dimension,

sequential/global dimension.</p>
      <p>The identified relationships provide additional
information about the learners. This additional
information can be used in systems that consider only
either learning styles or cognitive traits to extend the
student model. This leads to more holistic adaptivity
by including both learning styles and WMC.
Furthermore, the additional information from the
relationship can be used to improve the detection of
learning styles and/or cognitive traits. This strengthens
the existing student models and leads to a better
support for holistic adaptivity.</p>
      <p>Future work will deal with a more granular analysis
by considering specific characteristics within the
FSLSM dimensions and looking at their relationships
to WMC. Furthermore, we plan to incorporate the
findings of this study into the CTM in order to improve
the inference process of WMC. We also plan to build a
learning style student model using the additional
information about cognitive traits in order to improve
the automatic student modelling approach.</p>
