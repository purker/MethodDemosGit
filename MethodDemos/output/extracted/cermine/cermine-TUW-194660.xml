        <p>- Interaction Nets are a novel model of computation based on graph rewriting. Their main properties are parallel evaluation and sharing of computation, which leads to efficient programs. However, Interaction Nets lack several features that allow for their convenient use as a programming language. In this paper, we describe the implementation of an extension for pattern matching of interaction rules. Furthermore, we show the correctness of the implementation and discuss its complexity. Interaction Nets were first introduced in [1]. A net is a graph consisting of agents (nodes) and ports (edges). x1@· · · xn α</p>

        <title>OVERVIEW</title>
        <p>Models of computation are the basis for many
programming languages. They allow for reasoning on formal
properties of programs such as their correctness and
termination (i.e., whether a program eventually halts). An
example is the λ-calculus, which is the basis for
functional programming languages such as Haskell.</p>
        <p>Interaction Nets are a relatively new model of
computation based on graph rewriting. They enjoy several
useful properties that give them great potential for a
future programming language. In this paper, we introduce
a method for extended pattern matching which allows for
the formulation of more powerful interaction rules. We
describe our recent contribution, an implementation of
the extended pattern matching, and discuss its properties.</p>
        <p>This paper is organised as follows: The next
subsection gives a short introduction to Interaction Nets. In
Section II., we introduce extended pattern matching and
outline its implementation. Finally, we present a
conclusion and give an outlook on further research.</p>

        <title>B. INTERACTION NETS</title>
        <p>Computation is modeled by rewriting the graph, which
is based on interaction rules. These rules apply to two
nodes which are connected by their principal ports
(denoted by the arrow). For example, the following two
rules model the addition of natural numbers (encoded by
0 and a successor function S):
+
=⇒
This simple system allows for parallel evaluation of
programs: If more than one interaction rule is applicable
at the same time, they can be applied in parallel
without interfering with each other. In addition, nets share
computation: If an expression appears multiple times in
a program, it is evaluated only once.</p>
        <p>II.</p>
        <p>
          NESTED PATTERN MATCHING AND ITS
IMPLEMENTATION
The simplicity of interaction rules brings a disadvantage:
Only the two nodes that are connected via their
principal ports are relevant to the rule. This makes it hard
to express functions that depend on more than two
nonvariable symbols, or in other words, have a more
complicated pattern. Consider a function that finds and returns
the last element of a list:
l a s t Cons ( x , N i l ) = x
l a s t Cons ( x , x s ) = l a s t x s
The first rule pattern includes three function symbols:
last, Cons and N il. Since interaction rules are restricted
to two function symbols per rule pattern (the names of the
agents), one has to introduce an auxiliary rule to model
this function:
l a s t Cons ( x , x s ) = a u x x x s
a u x x N i l = x
a u x x Cons ( y , y s ) = l a s t Cons ( y , y s )
To counter this problem, Interaction Nets with nested
patterns were introduced [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
          ]. Nested rules allow for
pattern matching of more complicated functions. The
beneficial properties of Interaction Nets are preserved if the
nested rules are of a specific form (i.e., well-formed).
Moreover, it is possible to transform nested rules into
ordinary ones by introducing auxiliary rules, much like in
the example above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first author contributed to this research by
implementing nested pattern matching in the Interaction Nets
based prototype programming language inets [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
          ]. The
corresponding theoretical description of this work was
presented at the workshop RULE’09 [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
          ]. In the
remainder of this section, we outline the main ingredients of the
implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The implementation consists of two parts:
1. Verification of the well-formedness of interaction
rules
2. Translation of nested rules into ordinary rules
Verification of well-formedness The well-formedness
property of a set of interaction rules ensures that there is
no overlap between rules: A given pair of agents (with
nested arguments) must not match more than one rule.
Otherwise, the rules cannot be applied in a
deterministic fashion which leads to inconsistent results. The
algorithm in inets tries to falsify this condition of the rule set:
It searches (exhaustively) for two nested patterns that can
match the same net. The condition is falsified if and only
if the set of rules is not well-formed. A formal proof can
be found in [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4 ref5">4, 5</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>
          Rule translation We now give an overview of the
actual translation of nested rules. This is done as follows:
The inets compiler reads source code and builds an
abstract syntax tree (AST) which is further compiled into
byte code and later C source code. Our translation
function rewrites ASTs that represent nested rules into ASTs
that represent ordinary interaction rules. The back end of
the compiler remains unaffected by the translation.
Overall, our translation function is similar to the compilation
schemes defined in the original paper [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
          ]. We summarise
the translation algorithm in the following steps:
1. A rule is found in the AST. If the rule has a nested
pattern, its well-formedness is verified.
2. If the rule is well-formed, it is translated: The first
nested argument is removed from the rule and an
auxiliary rule is generated. This rule is appended to
the AST.
3. The remaining nested agents are not (yet)
translated. They are resolved by translating the auxiliary
rule.
4. The AST is traversed until the next (unprocessed)
rule is found.
        </p>
        <p>This algorithm allows for an arbitrary number of nested
patterns (i.e., the number of nested agents in a nested
rule) and an arbitrary pattern depth.</p>
        <p>Properties of the translation We show that the
algorithm is terminating: The translation function either fails
(due to a non well-formed rule) or yields a set of
ordinary interaction rules. The idea behind the formal proof
is to show that the number of rules and nested patterns
decreases with each call of the translation function.</p>
        <p>
          The time and space complexity of the algorithm can be
described as follows: The time complexity of the
translation is O(n2) where n is the sum of the number of rules
and nested patterns in the input rule set. This is due to
(one part of) the well-formedness check that compares
each rule with every other rule ( n(n−1) checks are
per2
formed). Space complexity is linear with the number of
input rules. For a more detailed complexity discussion,
the reader is referred to [

          ].

      <title>CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK</title>
      <p>In this paper, we have given a short introduction to
Interaction Nets and their extension through nested
patterns. We have contributed to this field of research
by implementing a translation algorithm for nested
patterns in the Interaction Nets based programming
language inets. This algorithm includes verification of the
well-formedness of rules. Moreover, the translation
handles programming language features that are not part of
the original definition of the translation. Some
important examples are data values of agents (integers, floats,
strings,. . . ), side effects (declaration and manipulation of
variables, I/O) and conditions.</p>
      <p>Nested pattern matching can serve as a basis for
further language extensions for Interaction Nets. These
extensions are pursued in the context of the PhD project of
the first author which is funded by the Austrian Academy
of Sciences (O¨ AW) and the Vienna PhD School of
Informatics.</p>
