        <p>The role of medical guidelines is becoming more and more important in the medical field. Within the Protocure project it has been shown that the quality of medical guidelines can be improved by formalisation.

This paper presents a case study where the relation between the informal medical guideline and its formal counterpart is investigated. This has been used to determine the gaps between the formal and informal guidelines and the cause of the size explosion of the formal guidelines.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        Medical practice guidelines are “systematically developed statements to assist
practitioners and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific circumstances”
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ]. They contain more or less precise recommendations about the medical tests or
interventions to perform, or about other aspects of clinical practice. These guidelines are
used by a wide variety of medical professionals: medical specialists, family doctors,
hospital nurses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interest in medical guidelines has resulted in the development of a number of
special purpose knowledge representation languages intended for modelling guidelines
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3 ref7 ref9">3, 7, 9</xref>
        ]. They provide the opportunity to formalise informal guidelines into more
formal objects. However formalisation of a guideline turns out to be a very time-consuming
task, resulting in a formal guideline that is much more complex than the original
version and even more importantly the relation between the informal (original) and formal
guideline is not always clear: which parts of the informal guideline correspond to which
parts of the formal model, are all parts of the informal guideline covered in the formal
model, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        This paper presents the results of an analysis (more fully reported in [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ])of two
informal medical guidelines and their formalised counterparts. For this analysis the
relation between the informal guideline and formal guideline was made explicit. The
focus of the analysis was among others: (1) whether everything in the original guideline
that should have been modelled has in practice been modelled; (2) whether elements in
the formal guideline are explicitly stated, implicitly stated or completely missing in
the original guideline; (3) why formal guidelines are so much bigger in size than their
informal counterparts.
      </p>
      <p>The contribution of this analysis is the categorisation of the gaps between informal
and formal versions of the guidelines, a clarification of the size explosion and last but
not least the explicit representation of the relation between two selected informal
guidelines and their formal counterparts. The latter among others resulted in the visualisation
of anomalies already found during the formalisation.</p>
      <p>The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes our case study. Section
3 discusses the gaps between the informal and formal representations of guidelines and
our observations in the process of making the relation between informal and formal
models explicit. Section 4 indicates the causes of increased complexity in the formal
models. Finally section 5 concludes and discusses some open issues and future work.

      <title>The case study</title>
      <p>
        This study has been carried out within the Protocure project (www.protocure.org), a
European project which aims to evaluate the use of formal methods for quality
improvement of medical guidelines. The guidelines selected and formalised in Asbru [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ]
within the Protocure project have been used as a starting point. The definition of the
relations between the original and formal guideline has been done with the Guideline
Markup Tool [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        The selected guidelines The guidelines that have been used in this study are the
American Academy of Pediatrics practice guideline for the Management of
Hyperbilirubinemia in the Healthy Term Newborn [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ] and the Dutch College of General
Practitioners (NHG) standard for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        Asbru: a representation language for medical guidelines Asbru is a plan
representation language to represent clinical guidelines as time-oriented, skeletal plans [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ]. It
can be used to express clinical guidelines as skeletal plans that can be instantiated for
every patient. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>In Asbru a clinical guideline consists of a name, a set of arguments, including a
time annotation (representing the temporal scope of the plan) and five elementary
components: preferences, intentions, conditions, effects and a plan body, which describes
the actions to be executed. The plan name is compulsory and all the other components
are optional. Each plan may contain an arbitrary number of subplans within its plan
body, which may themselves be decomposed into sub-subplans. So a plan can include
several potentially decomposable sequential, concurrent or cyclical plans.</p>
      <p>
        Guideline Markup Tool GMT is an editor that helps translating guidelines from free
text into Asbru [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ]. One of the functionalities of this tool that has been used in this
case study is to define links between an original guideline (in the form of a natural
text with tables and diagrams), and its Asbru model. To define a link the user selects a
piece of the original guideline and a related piece of the formal guideline and inserts a
link, which connects the two pieces. With this functionality all the relations between an
original guideline and its formal model have been defined.
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>Linking: the relation between a formal and informal guideline</title>
      <p>Within this study we obtain insight in the relation between original and formalised
guideline by defining a link for each relationship between the two versions of guidelines
with the Guideline Markup Tool. These links between the original guideline and its
formal model can serve different purposes: (i) to give insight in the relation between the
original guideline and its formalisation. (ii) to enable discussion with domain experts.
(iii) to reveal if everything in the original guideline that should have been modelled in
the formal guidelines really has been modelled. (iv) in case the original guideline is
updated, changes can much easier be made in the formal model, since the place where
the adjustment should be made can easily be found with the link pointing there. (v) to
help the modeller during the formalisation process.</p>
      <p>
        Types of links The links that have been defined within this study can roughly be
distinguished in two ways. A link can be characterised as explicit or implicit.
Furthermore the level (high or low) at which a link is defined can be different (see [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ]). Below,
we discuss the explicit and implicit links in more detail.
      </p>
      <p>Explicit links are links that show a very direct, obvious relation. For example the
original diabetes guideline speaks about ”fat metabolism problems” and the formal
diabetes guideline uses the condition ”fat-metabolism = true”. Implicit links on the other
hand are much less apparent. They do relate two parts of the original and formalised
guideline that belong together, but the relation is not completely fitting.</p>
      <p>Several reasons for implicit links can be identified. For example domain experts may
have clarified terms that are vague in the original guideline. This results in a detailed
statement in the formalisation, which is related to a more vague statement in the original
guideline. For example the original diabetes guidelines speaks about ”older age”, which
with advice from domain experts has been translated with ”age &gt; 60”.</p>
      <p>Another reason for an implicit link can be the need for a certain medical parameter.
To be able to use this parameter its value first needs to be obtained. Original guidelines
mostly consider it to be clear this value needs to be obtained and don’t mention it
explicitly. In the formal guideline, on the other hand an explicit statement to obtain this
value is needed.</p>
      <p>Third of all, common knowledge in the original guideline can cause a different
model in the formalisation. For example the diabetes guideline prescribes to check the
blood pressure. It can be considered as a common fact that for checking blood
pressure, both lower and higher blood pressure need to be measured. In this case the
original guideline speaks about ”blood pressure”, while the formal guideline speaks about
”higher blood pressure” and ”lower blood pressure”, which results in two implicit links.</p>
      <p>Finally sometimes related aspects in the original guideline are put together in a
”superplan”, which is subdivided in subplans that represent these different aspects.
Besides explicit links to these subplans, also an implicit link from the ”superplan” to the
collection of related aspects is desirable.</p>
      <p>The distinction between explicit and implicit links shows that some of the relations
between the original guideline and its formal guideline are very obvious, but others are
much more indirect for various reasons.</p>
      <p>
        Analysis of defined links During the formalisation process of the two guidelines
different anomalies have been identified and documented [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ]. Some of these
anomalies concerned information that was missing from the original guideline. The linking
process makes these pieces of missing information visually apparent, because they are
parts of the formal guideline that remain unrelated to any part of the informal guideline.
      </p>
      <p>One of the most surprising results was that new anomalies were uncovered. Some
had not been identified during the formalisation process and others had even been
introduced during the formalisation process.</p>
      <p>Furthermore the links have visualised those parts of the original guideline that have
not been translated in the formal guideline. These links give insight in the choices of
the modeller of the formal guideline.</p>
      <p>Not only are there parts of the original guideline that remain unlinked, there are even
more parts of the formal model that remain unlinked, because there is no direct relation
with the original guideline. Mostly this is caused by information that is not explicit in
the original guideline but thought necessary in the formal guideline. These unlinked
parts show that the formal guidelines are much more extensive compared to the original
guideline, in this study considered as extra complexity. The next section will deal with
all the different aspects causing this extra complexity that have been identified on the
basis of the defined links.

    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>Where does the complexity come from?</title>
      <p>Formal guidelines turn out to be much more extensive than their original versions.
Considering the two guidelines used in this study, jaundice consisted originally of 8 pages
and its formalisation in an intermediate representation form is 40 pages long. The
diabetes model is even 56 pages long while its original covered only 4 pages.</p>
      <p>We distinguish three main causes of this additional complexity: additional
information, domain specification and nearly identical plans. In this section we focus on the
first cause additional info, which is illustrated with six concrete reasons. During the
formalisation of medical guidelines, additional information can be necessary for a proper
formalisation. The additional information can appear in different forms:
1. Background knowledge. First of all medical guidelines in general assume certain
background knowledge to be common knowledge for medical practitioners.</p>
      <p>2. Missing information about conditions. Conditions control the sequence of
proposed actions in the guideline. Sometimes a condition is implicitly derived from the
original guideline or derived from additional information that has been gained from
domain experts.</p>
      <p>3. The intentions of plans. When actions are performed with respect to medical
diagnosis or treatment, it is often useful to realise why this action is being performed at
all. This can be expressed by defining the intentions of a plan. In most cases intentions
are not explicitly stated in the original guideline, but considered to be known by the
medical practitioner.</p>
      <p>4. Missing information about the repetition of actions. In a cyclical plan the
definition of the time-interval on which the plan should be repeated, the so-called retry delay
has to be specified. Sometimes this retry delay has to be gained from a medical expert.</p>
      <p>5. An important aspect of medical guidelines is how all the different steps and
actions within the guideline are managed. Should the specified plans and actions be
performed in parallel, in sequence etc. ? To be able to represent these kind of control
aspects a formal representation language should provide control structures to define how
the plans of a guideline should be executed. Asbru contains many different kind of such
control structures. Many times this control information is not explicitly stated in the
original guideline. It can be either derived from the original guideline or obtained from
domain experts.</p>
      <p>6. A plan can be user-performed, which means this plan is executed through some
action by the user. Mostly it is apparent which actions should be executed by the user
so this is not explicitly stated in the original guideline.</p>
      <p>We give some numbers for illustrating how the above different complexity aspects
appear in the two selected guidelins. Conditions: 14 times in Jaundice, 24 times in
Diabetes; Intentions: 18 times in Jaundice, 17 times in Diabetes; Retry delays: once
in Jaundice, 5 times in Jaundice; Control structures: 28 times in Jaundice, 50 times in
Diabetes; User-performed plans: 19 times in Jaundice, 20 times in Diabetes.</p>
      <p>All the aspects of increasing complexity mentioned above appear in Asbru, but will
also show up in any other formal representation language.

    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>We have presented an analysis of the relationship between an informal medical
guideline and its formal counterpart. It turned out different sorts of relationships could be
identified. Links can be either explicit or implicit and they can appear at high or low
level. Furthermore some of the anomalies that had already been found during
formalisation were nicely visualised and surprisingly also new anomalies were found.</p>
      <p>Not all parts of both the original guidelines as well as the formal guideline could
be related to their counterpart though. Some parts of the original guideline remained
unlinked, but even a bigger amount of the formal guideline remained unlinked. All
appearances of this last example indicate causes of the size explosion of formal guidelines.
All these reasons of increased complexity have been categorised.</p>
      <p>Challenges for the future can be found in developing medical guidelines hand in
hand with their formal counterparts assisted by the definition of the links between them.
The modeling choices are then explicit represented and formal and informal guidelines
are no longer separated objects.</p>
