        <p>As part of the project “Educational standards in vocational schools” the responsible Federal Ministry compiled competence models, descriptors and didactic examples for Informatics in technical high schools (HTL). The implementation of this project implies a paradigm shift for the vocational school system, which requires a new pedagogic foundation. This paper presents a didactical concept, that meets the requirements of the educational standards in general and competence orientation in particular. A proposal for the implementation of these educational standards in the competence area industrial information technology (INIT) is presented. The specification is based on selected teaching sessions for micro controller technique. Learner-oriented teaching methods are applied, along with procedures to promote the learners' intrinsic motivation and creativity in general. It became apparent that the competence area INIT conveys remarkably demanding learning outcomes and its implementation proved challenging on multiple levels.</p>

      <p>Austria’s school system is in a flux, educational standards and competence orientation
are the two key topics. The declared objectives in this process are a sustainable
increase of quality and a better comparability of educational attainment.</p>
      <p>
        This change is already partly implemented: in 2011, the Federal Ministry of
Education, Arts and Culture (bm:ukk) released new educational standards for the vocational
school system [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ] which are orientated towards the development of well-defined
competences. To this end, the ministry compiled competence models, descriptors and
didactic examples for Informatics in technical high schools (HTL) as part of the
project “educational standards in vocational schools”.
      </p>
      <p>These new curricula induce a twofold change: new contents and an orientation
towards competence attainment. While the adaptation of the contents is caused by the
dynamics of IT, the change towards competences bears challenges on multiple levels.
The predominant method in the class rooms is still ex-cathedra teaching where the
students assume a rather passive role. This is in conflict with the characteristics of
competence orientation which calls for a paradigm shift in teaching. Therefore, new
didactic concepts have to be developed that cater to the new contents and the demands
of competence orientated teaching.</p>
      <p>This paper deals with the development and implementation of a didactic concept
for the competence field “Industrial Information Technology” (INIT) within the
vocational schools for information technology (HTL for IT) as a case study. The pursuit of
this new concept entails the following central questions:</p>
      <p>Q1: In which way should teaching be designed as to ensure the educational
standards for the competence field INIT?</p>
      <p>Q2: In which way can be ensured that individual learning goals are attained in
combination with personal and social competencies?</p>
      <p>Q3: To what extent does a specific school influence the implementation of the new
curricula with respect to activity-oriented teaching methods?</p>
      <p>Q4: In which way should teaching be designed as to foster creativity and intrinsic
motivation?</p>
      <p>Section 2 of this paper discusses Austria’s approach towards competence
orientation within the vocational schools for IT. In section 3 the case study is presented.
Finally, an evaluation and discussion can be found in section 4.

      <title>Competence Orientation at Vocational Schools for IT</title>
      <p>Educational standards can be seen as precise and binding expectations regarding
competence attainments of the learners. A so-called competence model (c.f. section
2.2) serves as basis for the definition of the aspired competences, which include
operational competences with respect to the learning content. These competences
comprise expertise and methodological competences, as well as social and personal
competences. Competence orientation in education systems means a focus on fostering the
desired competences.</p>
      <p>
        One of the reasons for a shift towards competence orientation lies in the
comparability of education systems. To that extent, the EU developed the European
Qualifications Framework (EQF) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ] in 2008.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to improve the quality of informatics education by means of standards and
competences, there have been initiatives in Germany, like MoKoM [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ] or the GI
standards [4].
      </p>
      <p>The current initiative in Austria is based on Weinert’s definition of competence
[5]. The legal basis for competence orientation in vocational schools in Austria is the
enactment of the respective curricula [6]. Details for the implementation can be found
in the ministry’s report “educational standards for vocational schools” [7].
2.1</p>
      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>Teaching Competencies</title>
        <p>Austria’s new educational standards define the desired learning attainments in terms
of competencies. Adequate teaching methods are required for the learners to acquire
these competencies effectively [8, 9, 10]. These have to go beyond the conveyance of
factual knowledge.</p>
        <p>The ministry’s report “teaching competencies” [11] still defines the main
components of teaching as planning, delivering, and assessment, which accounts for
traditional teaching as well. New territory has to be conquered with regard to the teaching
methods: They should aim at establishing operational competence, skills and abilities,
along with personal and social competence. A major difference lies in the
learnercentered approach as opposed to traditional subject-centered or teacher-centered
methods. More specifically, learners are no longer mostly passive consumers of
conveyed information, but are put to action.</p>
        <p>In this sense the teacher becomes a learning coach, while the learners are
encouraged to actively work through the contents, thereby acquiring the desired
competences. The teacher’s responsibility shifts towards providing suitable conditions, materials
and a productive atmosphere. In addition to factual knowledge, an interdisciplinary
embedding of knowledge and skills plays a central role. For teachers this implies a
coordination and alignment with other teachers with respect to content and timing.</p>
        <p>The ministry’s report [11] further identifies the following criteria as essential to
successful competence orientated teaching: Structured teaching with clearly defined
objectives; Diversity of methods, variable forms of learning; Assessment-free space
for exercises; Facilitation of experiencing competence increase; Motivating
environment; Development of the ability to accept criticism; Sufficient time for learning
processes.

      <sec id="sec-2-2">
        <title>Competence model</title>
        <p>The ministry’s competence model defines the desired learning outcomes by means of
competences. It consists of the two dimensions “content” and “action”, as depicted in
fig. 1.</p>
        <p>For a vocational school for information technology (HTL IT) the dimension
“content” defines the contents that are taught in IT. These include software development,
IT projects, and systems engineering as competence fields. For the case study in this
paper the competence area industrial information technology (INIT) has been selected
which belongs to the competence field “systems engineering”. Other areas in this flied
are: electrical engineering and electronics for IT, basics of informatics, operating
systems, system integration and infrastructure, and decentralized systems.</p>
        <p>The dimension “action” defines the cognitive effort. This is based on the revised
Bloom’s taxonomy [12] where the cognitive area of learning goals has been
subdivided into six categories: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create.
For Austria’s educational standards, the ministry combined the first two categories
[13]. The ministry’s report “educational standards for vocational schools” [7] serves
1 Software Development</p>
        <p>2 IT Projects
3 Information Systems
4 Systems Engineering
5 Media Technology
6 Networks
as a basis for the dimension “action”, together with the more specific “educational
standards for information technology” [14].</p>
        <p>Content Dimension
As can be seen in fig. 1, descriptors are the intersection points of the dimensions
“action” and “content”. They describe the expectation in the form of resulting
competences. The ministry defined a coding syntax [13] for the descriptors in order to
uniquely assign them to competence areas:
&lt;school type&gt;&lt;school focus&gt; - &lt;content&gt; . &lt;index&gt; - &lt;action&gt;</p>
        <p>For the school type vocational school for information technology (HTL IT), the
code is IT, for the school focus “system engineering” the code is S. For basic topics
the code for the school focus is generally omitted. The code for content is a numerical
value indicating one of the main educational topics (in our case “systems
engineering” is represented by 3). The index is used to distinguish multiple descriptors within
an educational topic. For basics the index can run up to 100. Indices with a value over
100 indicate focus topics. The code for actions is a letter, where A represents the
category “remember and understand”. To illustrate this coding, a few descriptors [13] are
listed below:</p>
        <p>IT-5.1-B</p>
        <p>I am able to explain the main scalar data types of a high-level
programming language.</p>
        <p>I am able to assess an operating system and to choose an appropriate
one for a given purpose.</p>
        <p>According to [13] IT-5.1-B is assigned to the competence area software
development. The student should understand and be able to describe the taught contents
“scalar data types”. IT-3.23-D represents the 23rd competence in the area of systems
engineering at the level of analyzing.

      <title>Case study at HTL Krems</title>
      <p>For the case study the vocational school HTL Krems (http://www.htlkrems.ac.at) was
chosen. The school’s intent is to follow the state-of-the-art as closely as possible,
which was demonstrated by their great interest in participating in this case study. The
implementation of the developed didactic concept was done at the school’s
department for information technology.</p>
      <p>The recently enacted new curricula [6] had to be applied for the first time in the
school year 2011/2012 for all first grades in the vocational school.

        <title>HTL (Technical High Schools)</title>
        <p>Vocational schools. Vocational schools take five years (from year 9 to 13) and award
a diploma that not only certifies professional qualifications but also allows university
access. This type of school is deeply rooted in the Austrian education system with a
fine tradition. According to [15] about half of the roughly 8000 diploma holder per
year opt for tertiary education. Those who enter the job market are very welcome by
employers [16].</p>
        <p>
          In an international comparison it is hard to classify those diplomas. Within the
ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education) [17] it could be classified
between 4A and 5B [18]. To help with the international comparison of educational
qualification, Europe developed the European Qualification Framework (EQF) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
          ]
which defines attainment in the categories “knowledge”, “skills”, and “competencies”
at eight levels.

        <title>Technical High School for Information Technology (HTL IT). Within the range</title>
        <p>of vocational schools there are the technical high schools, the so-called HTL, which
come in several different flavors, e.g. for Information Technology (IT). These school
types devote about half of the weekly hours to general subjects, and the remainder to
IT specific ones.</p>
        <p>Among the IT specific subjects, the competence field “systems engineering”
covers the most weekly hours, namely 31 over the five years. Systems engineering
comprises the competence areas: electrical engineering and electronics for IT, basics of
informatics, operating systems, system integration and infrastructure, decentralized
systems, and industrial information technology (INIT).</p>
        <p>Competence area INIT. For the case study, the competence area INIT was
selected which is taught in years 4 and 5. The desired competences for those years [14] are
listed in the tables 1 and 2.</p>
        <p>These competences are not assigned to a school year, neither in the curriculum nor
in the educational standards. So it is obviously left to the teacher’s responsibility.

        <title>Requirements</title>
        <p>Based on the given constraints the following requirements for the teaching concept
could be derived. These requirements are intended for the school years 4 and 5
(overall years 12, 13). In order to increase clarity, four clusters have been formed:</p>

      <title>Evaluation and Discussion</title>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>Evaluation</title>
        <p>The change of paradigm towards competence orientation proved challenging for both,
teachers and students. Apart from obstacles in administration and organization, the
change to student-centered teaching makes great demands on teachers. Teachers are
used to being the center and to immediately react to fuzziness in the learning process.
This is in conflict with student-centered teaching which should allow sufficient space
for the student’s own exploration. Aside from necessary self-discipline, phases for
correction of the instructional process are required. This has to be adequately
considered during planning.</p>
        <p>Concerning methods which reflect the student-centeredness (e.g. group puzzle[9])
it must be reported that students do not necessarily appreciate them. Especially
students with a performance level well above average moan about the lack of balance
regarding the cost-benefit ratio. They spend a lot of time instructing others with little
gain for themselves. These students prefer ex-cathedra teaching because of the
condensed information supply. Nevertheless, they appreciate the social aspect of the new
teaching methods. It would be interesting to see a long-term evaluation for differently
gifted groups of students.</p>
        <p>With regard to the implementation it may be noted, that for grade 4 in HTL
(overall grade 12) competencies are limited by the level “Apply”. Even for that, the
intended period of 11 weeks of instruction has been overly ambitious. More realistically, 15
weeks should be planned. The general division of the topics into three major blocks
proved useful. It turned out that a major difficulty lies in the strict two hour limit for
practical exercises. Especially, if specialized hardware was used which had to be
reassembled every time from scratch, valuable time was lost. The students, however, did
not complain extensively as the reassembly reinforced the general understanding of
the circuits. Alternatively, pre-assembled hardware with peripheral components could
be used (e.g. buttons, LCD).</p>
        <p>In order to accommodate for individualization within the practical exercises,
individual learning goals have been agreed upon. Especially students who work faster
chose their own additional tasks. Interestingly, this turned out to be motivating for
other students, as well. A possible reason for this effect could be the inspiring
demonstration of the creative possibilities of the employed evaluation kit. Generally, it could
be observed that the chosen contents and exercises were conducive to the intrinsic
motivation of the students. It can be concluded that the employment of suitable
hardware kits seems essential.</p>
        <p>Concerning multidisciplinary aspects, the competence areas “IT projects” has been
successfully coupled with the competence area “project management”. For “project
management” which is taught 4 hours per week, the students had to accomplish
projects with contents from INIT. Results show that the students’ choices for INIT
contents were highly ambitious and far beyond the content requirements.</p>
        <p>In summary it can be concluded, that the presented didactical concept served as a
solid basis for developing the desired competencies up to the level “apply”. There is
potential for improvement concerning the theory part “micro controller” which was
too ambitious for one teaching unit.
4.2</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-2">
        <title>Discussion</title>
        <p>The initially posed central questions can be answered as follows:</p>
        <p>Q1: In which way should teaching be designed as to ensure the educational
standards for the competence field INIT?</p>
        <p>The presented concept had the educational standards as requirements, and therefore
shows a possible implementation strategy, but definitely not the only one. School
specific requirements were considered, as well. These might differ from other
schools, and again represent one of many possible implementations. The distinction
into theory and practice blocks was a school requirement, but proved useful. In order
to support the combination of theory and practice, the contents have been subdivided
into three major topics. Furthermore, the theory sessions have been designed in an
open way as to facilitate constructivist learning processes. The application of
activityoriented teaching methods has been favored, as well as conceptual knowledge.
Contrary to the theory session, the practical exercises (workshops) were more restrictive
with respect to the activity and expected results.</p>
        <p>It has to be mentioned that there is only a single example in [14] for the
competence area INIT. This is problematic since the educational standards are fairly general
and leave plenty of room for interpretation. Furthermore, it becomes evident that both,
the curriculum as well as the educational standards, are rather ambitious in view of
the available time frame. Therefore it should be discussed as to what extent the area
of SPC correlates with the profile of a HTL IT in general. Instead, it might be more
advisable to emphasize micro controllers.</p>
        <p>Q2: In which way can be ensured that individual learning goals are attained in
combination with personal and social competencies?</p>
        <p>The didactical concept is based on the idea of achieving personal and social skills
mainly during the theory sessions. In contrast, the practical exercises focus on
individual attainment as they demand the student’s own effort to find solutions. Later on,
the practical exercises include group work as well, where social interaction is a
necessary part of the task, but personal outcomes are defined, as well.</p>
        <p>Q3: To what extent does a specific school influence the implementation of the new
curricula with respect to activity-oriented teaching methods?</p>
        <p>The school specific requirement to distinguish theory and practice blocks bears
advantages as well as disadvantages. Most students appreciate the concept “Theory
deals with general concepts, while practical exercises deal with a specific
technology.” Problems mainly arise from the organizational limit of 50-minutes sessions. The
consequences of splitting tasks over several sessions remain to be seen. Concerning
activity-oriented teaching methods, the average class size seems to be challenging. In
general, there is little flexibility for schools to influence class sizes; a deviation from
50-minutes sessions is possible, but requires a huge organizational effort.</p>
        <p>The requirement for sufficient time for reflection had to be planned ahead, but does
not pose a problem in general. Also multidisciplinary aspects have to be planned in
advance as it requires intensive coordination efforts by the participating teachers.</p>
        <p>Q4: In which way should teaching be designed as to foster creativity and intrinsic
motivation?</p>
        <p>The open approach to theory sessions provides space for personal development.
Activity-oriented methods are generally conducive to intrinsic motivation, as students
tend to acquit themselves well when asked to actively contribute.</p>
        <p>An evaluation kit was used for the practical exercises. Thereby the students could
test their solutions on physical hardware which could be adjusted to the individual
tasks. Both, testing and individualization increased the motivation. There was a
choice of possible tasks, with the possibility of individual flair. Tasks were
formulated as questions or hypotheses with the intent to arise the student’s interest.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, it can be stated that, due to the complexity of teaching competences,
teachers are required to exhibit an appropriate willingness, as well as sufficient skills
for this approach. This starts with a fundamental acceptance of competence
orientation.</p>
        <p>With the definition of descriptors, it seems that essential steps towards educational
standards for IT have been made, while some details are still missing. This can be
derived from the fact that the descriptors in [13] for the educational basics are a draft
version. Also, while the competence model in [13] uses five dimensions, the one in
[14] applies six dimensions. A synthesis of these two documents [13, 14] is advisable.
Additionally, to implement these educational standards, the completion of the
prototypical instruction examples in [14] is of great importance. Furthermore, the coding
syntax of [13] was not applied in [14], which only represents a minor problem.</p>
        <p>As stated by Reinbacher [19] as well, time will prove whether this approach to
competence orientation in vocational schools actually is an important step towards an
increase in quality. To achieve this long-term goal it is indispensable to provide a
fully developed competence model with descriptors that reflect the state-of-the-art.</p>
        <p>In any case, the comparison between educational programs should be more feasible
than before.
