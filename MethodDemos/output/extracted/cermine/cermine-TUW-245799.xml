        <p>ANALELE UNIVERSITĂŢII The diagnosis of failures in train traffic installations can be done in several ways: direct observations and measurements, software assisted diagnosis using specific software packages, process variable monitoring for electronically centralized installations. This work presents basic concepts for Model Based Diagnosis (MBD) that uses fuzzy logic to analyse the integrity of Centralized Traffic Control Installations (CTC) in train traffic. We define the diagnosis relations to be used and show how to apply them to train traffic security installations. Implementing these concepts into an expert system assists maintenance operators in quick failure diagnosis of the train traffic security installations.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Railroad Centralized Traffic Control installations are very complex systems that
command and control train traffic, being essential in train traffic security. Train
stations where the CTC installation is electro-dynamically realised (ED-CTC) have
more complex subsystems, each of them, again, having subcomponents that
interact with each other. Each subsystem interacts with other subsystems, therefore
the safety of the traffic passing an ED-CTC station is ensured when all subsystems
function within normal parameter values.</p>
      <p>Fig. 1 shows the interconnection block schema for a railway station with CTC
and ABS (Automatic Block Signalling) installations.</p>
      <p>All subsystems are controlled through the command console, any failure of
the one or more subsystem causing an irregular behaviour of the whole system,
behaviour which is usually signalled. Diagnosing the system or the subsystem is
necessary in order to detect the failing component(s) that are the cause of the
faulty behaviour.</p>
      <p>Currently, for these types of installations, the failure diagnosis is done by
direct observations of the various signals and measurements of equipment states.
The diagnosis time strongly depends on the maintenance staff’s detailed
knowledge on the whole system and subsystems internals.</p>
      <p>
        This work proposes to develop an expert system (ES) that uses fuzzy logic to
diagnose CTC stations. ESs are used also in power electric systems [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>The expert system will receive information from various subsystem
components and will process and compare them with the ES model. The ES output will be
a minimal set of causes for the signalled system misbehaviour, corresponding to
the signals displayed.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>2. Principles of the Model Based Diagnosis</title>
      <p>To better understand the basic principles in the model based diagnosis we will
use the word system to refer to both systems and subsystems.</p>
      <p>
        To use the model based diagnosis it is necessary to completely describe each
system component. This step is called system description, SD [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref2">1,2</xref>
        ]. Logical
relations that describe how the components work, the links between components, and
the workings of the whole system are established. These relations are, in fact,
propositional logic sentences that form the system’s propositional logic, SPL.
      </p>
      <p>A logical consequence of the detailed and correct system description is the
correct operation of the system. Any discrepancy between the system’s punctual
behaviour (pointwise) and its description is caused by a faulty component. Thus
the system description is based on the logical propositions that describe the
components, their operation and the links between them.</p>
      <p>To diagnose a system we must identify all the discrepancies between the
system description and its running behaviour. Each discrepancy (or symptom) is
determined by a set of concurrent components, CC, which are candidate components
for the respective symptom. We can write:</p>
      <p>An example of a defect, in our case, is the fact that an entry signal cannot be
commanded on the ‘free’ position. The concurrent components of this symptom
are: damaged track circuit, damaged track point, faulty power feed installation,
line occupied by rolling stock, previously executed movement on the same line,
damaged command apparatus. Based on observations it is noted that the system
failure is caused by the track circuit which does not function properly. In this case
the main candidate components are: safeties, transformers, IMVS, BDF, TR relays,
the track relay, the filter, the railway tracks, connections, ropes (Fig. 2).</p>

(2)
The faults in the track circuit operations are caused by the breakdown of one or
more candidate components in the CD set.</p>
        <p>We continue with some further basic definitions and relations in the model
based diagnosis systems.</p>
        <p>
          The CD’s operation state is described by a predicate, AB, which indicates the
abnormal operation (faulty state). The normal operation state is given by ¬AB [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
          ].
        </p>
      </sec>

    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>Definition 1: System description</title>
      <p>A functional system, FS, is described by the pair (SD, CD):
where:
- CD is a finite candidate system components set;
- SD is a finite subset of system’s propositional logic, SPL.</p>
      <p>The system diagnosis, ∆, is applied when the following holds:</p>
      <p>SD ∪ CD ≠ FS</p>
      <p>
        Using the AB predicate we can describe the components’ functional
properties. Suppose we want to express the following sentence: “Normally, the NF1-800
operating voltage is between 8 V and 12 V” [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ]. Then, the corresponding relation
is:
      </p>
      <p>NF1 - 800 (CD ∧) voltage (CD, u ∧)
¬AB (u ) ⊃ rate (u ≥ 8) ∧ rate (u ≤ 14)</p>
      <p>With the same predicate we can describe the possible effects of the
components with the relation:</p>
      <p>type (CD) ∧ AB (CD) ⊃ fault1 (CD) ∨ fault2 (CD) ∨ ... ∨ faultn (CD)
where type can be: relays, safeties, transformers, etc.</p>

    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>Definition 2: Observing the system</title>
      <p>Observing the system, OBS, is a finite set of first order logic sentences that
are used to diagnose the system. Therefore, the functional system can be
described by the relation:</p>
      <p>FS ⊃ SD ∪ CD ∪ OBS</p>
      <p>These observations belong to the system’s propositional logic and their role is
to signal the system’s faulty behaviour.</p>

      <title>Definition 3: System diagnosis</title>
      <p>The system diagnosis is a minimal set Δ ⊆ CD , such that:</p>
      <p>The diagnosis aims to discover the faulty component that causes the whole
system to misbehave. The conditions to apply the diagnosis are:
a) We use the diagnosis for the system (SD, CD, OBS) if:
b) { } is a diagnosis for the (SD, CD, OBS) system if:</p>
      <p>SD ∪ OBS ∪{¬AB (c) c ∈ CD} ∃
c)
Δ = {AB (ci )} is a diagnosis for the (SD, CD, OBS) system if:</p>
      <p>SD ∪ OBS ∪ {¬AB (c) c ∈ CD - Δ }= AB (ci ) (11)
d) Δ ⊆ CD is a diagnosis for the (SD, CD, OBS) system if ∆ is a minimal set
such that:</p>
      <p>SD ∪ OBS ∪ {¬AB (c) c ∈ CD - Δ }∃</p>

      <title>Definition 4: System’s conflicts</title>
      <p>A set of conflicts of the (SD, CD, OBS) system is a set F = {c1, c2 ,..., cn } ,

(10)
(12)
with F ⊆ CD , such that:</p>
      <p>SD ∪ OBS ∪{¬AB (c1 ) , ¬AB (c1 ) ,..., ¬AB (c1 )} does not exist
(13)
Relation (12) can be redefined using the conflict set terms:
Δ ⊆ CD is a diagnosis for the (SD, CD, OBS) system if ∆ is a minimal set
such that CD - Δ is not a conflict set for (SD, CD, OBS).</p>

      <title>Definition 5: The goal set:</title>
      <p>Let C be a collection of sets. A goal set for C is a set H ⊆ ∪ S∈C S , such that
H ∩ S ≠ {∅} for any S ∈ C . O goal set for C is minimal if none of its subsets is

- The CTC installation that is to be monitored at various points and
diagnosed;
- The Expert System that loads into the knowledge base the set of rules for
the normal operation state of the installation. The knowledge base is
loaded from the database of system elements. These rules are processed
by the inference engine that uses fuzzy logic operators [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
          ].
- The user interface where the conflict sets are displayed.
        </p>
        <p>In this work we show an expert system designed to diagnose a CTC type CR4
installation, on a track section with ABS installations.</p>
        <p>Fig. 4 shows the diagram of a railway station with 2 traffic lines.
In this figure we identify the following installations:
- Switch points (no. 1 and no. 2), which allow the train passage from one
line to the other;
- Track circuits (023 C, 024 C, 1C, II C) and isolated sections (1 Si, 2 Si)
which control the ‘open’ or ‘occupied’ track states and integrity;</p>
        <p>
          Light signals (X, X 1, X II, Y, Y 1, Y II) which signal whether the train
entry/exit into/out of the railway station is allowed;
The central post, PC, where the command and control panel is located, as
well as the relay room. The command and control apparatus and
commands the train traffic and monitors the installation’s conflictual state;
The ABS installation at the X and Y station ends. This installation
commands the traffic reversion [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
          ]. This installation contains light signals and
track circuits with specific characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>According to this scheme we created the block diagram for the installations
that deliver state information to the expert system (Fig. 5).</p>

The DS system description contains:
- The system’s topology;
- Locations of the measurement sensors for each mentioned installation;
- Nominal operation parameters for the main installation components;
- Limit parameter values for the operation of the main components in all
the mentioned installations;
- The fuzzy rules used to determine the fuzzy indicators.</p>
          <p>The CD set, described by ¬AB (c ) contains sentences of the form:
- The correct operation of the switch point (Mac)i is controlled by the point
control relays (KM) states, by the point position plus and minus control relays
(KMP, KMM) states, where i = 1, …, M and M is the number of point control relays
in the station;</p>
          <p>- The correct operation of the signal (Sign)j is controlled by the fire relay
FRA (fire red, white) states, by the fire relay FV1G (fire green, yellow 1) state, by
333
the fire relay FRA2G (fire red, white, yellow 2); where j = 1, …, S and S is the
number of fire relays in the station;</p>
          <p>- The correct operation of the (CDC)k track circuits is controlled by the C
track relays and Si isolated section relays, where k = 1, …, CC where CC is the
number of circuit control and section control relays in the station;</p>
          <p>- The correct operation of the (ABS)l is controlled by the OL (occupied line)
relay, KL (control line) relay, D (direction control) relay, where l = 1, …, L and L is
the number of ABS installations neighbouring the CTC station;</p>
          <p>- The correct operation of the power feed installation (ALIM) is controlled
by voltage monitoring relays: AM (switch point failure), AA (d.c. power feed), SR
(rectifier monitor), etc., where k = 1, …, AL where AL is the number of voltage
monitoring relays in the station.</p>
          <p>The union operator, SD ∪ CD , gives the following sentences:
- The operation of all switch points is correct;
- The operation of all track circuits and section circuits is correct
- The operation of all signals is correct;
- The operation of all ABS installations is correct;
- The electric power feed installation is correct;
The OBS observations set contains sentences of the following form:
- The switch point is positioned A;
- The point states is A;
- The track circuits state is A;
- The signals state is A;
- The ABS installation state is A;
- The electric power feed installation state is A,
where</p>
          <p>A ∈{optim, favorable, admissible, inadmissible}
(14)</p>
          <p>The diagnosis solution using the MBD system is the goal set ∆ that contains
subsets of the CD set defined like:
- The KMP voltage value is not optimal;
- The FRAG2 relay state is inadmissible, etc.</p>

      <title>4. Conclusion</title>
      <p>In this work we presented the basic concepts needed to apply the model
based diagnosis with an example of concept instantiation for CTC installations. We
proposed an expert system applicable to a train station with two traffic lines.</p>
      <p>The authors’ contributions are:
- Designing the basic block schema for the proposed expert system;</p>
      <p>Identifying the elements that need to be monitored and establishing how
they should be controlled;
Shortly describing the components that are part of the CD set;
Shortly describing the DS system and the corresponding operations;
Establishing a minimal set of observations.</p>
      <p>As future work we plan to further develop and implement this model for the
respective installations.
