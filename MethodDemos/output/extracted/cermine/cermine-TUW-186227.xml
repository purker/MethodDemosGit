        <p>- One indispensable precondition for designing a functional software product for the modeling and execution of a computerized clinical practice guideline (CPG) is the comprehensive investigation of the different user groups involved and the issues they encounter. This led us to conduct a comprehensive literature study about the tasks involved in modeling a CPG into a formal representation as well as about the information needs of caregivers, i.e., physicians and nurses, and last but not least the information needs of patients. We have assessed and categorized the above mentioned information in order to create a reliable starting point for the development of a functional software tool.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>
        CPGs [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ] are powerful tools to improve the quality of
healthcare [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref3">2, 3</xref>
        ]. In recent years different software
systems have been developed to support the design and
execution of CPGs [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4 ref5">4, 5</xref>
        ]. However, from the creation
of a computer-executable model of a CPG to its
actual implementation in clinical care a variety of tasks
emerge, such as translating the medical knowledge of
a textual CPG, i.e., recommendations, into a
computerinterpretable model, applying a recommended therapy on
a patient, or answering clinical questions.

      <sec id="sec-1-1">
        <title>Unfortunately, there is a lack of comprehensive infor</title>
        <p>
          mation on (1) the different user groups of a software tool
to support all of these tasks, (2) what tasks these users
want to perform, and (3) what information is required for
it. However, this information is mandatory to make valid
decisions on the design of such a software product [

      <title>INFORMATION NEEDS OF MODELERS</title>
      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>The main task of a guideline modeler is to create a for</title>
        <p>mal guideline representation model of the original
narrative guideline. There are two basic types of
formalization: a model-centric approach and a document-centric
approach.</p>
        <p>In any case, the modeler needs to know of which
components the target representation format is composed
(e.g., actions, decisions, states, subplans, and branches)
and in which way scheduling constraints are to be
modeled. Moreover, the modeler needs to identify the
relevant guideline knowledge and to disambiguate this
knowledge.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-2">
        <title>For model-centric formalization the modeler formu</title>
        <p>lates a conceptual model of a guideline without a
direct relationship between the original text and the model.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-3">
        <title>This modeling process involves steps like generating de</title>
        <p>tailed data models of clinical concepts and fundamental
parameters, specifying a logical and process structure
of the CPG, and modeling the guideline knowledge by
means of a flowchart-like graph.</p>
        <p>When modeling the guideline knowledge in an
document-centric way, the original text of the
document serves as a starting point which is systematically
marked up, whereupon the marked-up text parts are
structured into a – usually XML-based – model. This
includes making knowledge elements independent from
the surrounding text, modeling clinical actions, and
determining temporal constraints.</p>

      <title>CLINICAL INFORMATION NEEDS</title>
      <p>In addition, we have investigated user expectations and
requirements that have to be considered in creating a
clinically useful software environment. An outline of basic
categories of clinical information needs derived from
diverse studies is given in Figure 1.</p>

        <title>As regards the information sought by physicians, a number of studies has been conducted, mainly in the form of retrospective questionnaires, interviews, self-reports, and observation.</title>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-3-2">
        <title>According to these studies, the majority of questions</title>
        <p>posed by physicians deals with therapy and especially
with all sorts of aspects associated with medication.
Physicians seems to have a great need for information
about the correct drug, its effectiveness, its side effects,
its dosage, and how long it should be taken. Diagnostic
questions also appear quite frequently as do questions
about patient data and questions about other
healthcare providers. In contrast, questions concerning the
prognosis, the etiology of disease, etc. seem to be of
comparatively little concern, if we are to believe the
findings of the investigated studies.</p>

        <title>NURSES AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS</title>
        <p>When focusing on the information needs of nursing
staff, it is interesting to note that there is little
difference between the questions posed by nurses and what
the physicians want to know. The only real difference
seems to result from their different relationships to
patients: nurses are interested in psycho-social support of
patients whereas physicians have not formulated such
questions in the studies investigated in this paper.</p>
        <p>The main difference between nurses and nurse
practitioners is that the latter are more concerned with
diagnostic issues than nurses. In accordance with the results
for physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners need most
information about treatment and diagnosis, in which
they require information about institution specific
procedures and medication quite frequently.</p>

        <title>C. PATIENTS</title>
        <p>The information desired by patients is more voluminous
and differ qualitatively from either the questions
formulated by physicians or those formulated by nurses. Since
they are not only worried about illness itself but also
about the effects this illness has on family members,
precise information on circumstances they are likely to
expect when visiting other medical facilities, and, last
but not least, detailed information about available
support, such as psycho-social support, is required.</p>

        <title>In particular, patients require much more detailed in</title>
        <p>formation on emotional effects of their treatment and its
effects on their quality of life. As is to be expected,
prognosis and chances of recovery are also of major
interest for patients.</p>

        <title>By providing categorized information from several stud</title>
        <p>
          ies and publications, we establish an information basis
necessary for the design of a useful software tool
facilitating the modeling process and the execution of a CPG.
Depending on the potential and purpose of the
individual tool, it may not be necessary (nor always possible)
to include all of these tasks and information needs, but
the decision as to which points to include and which to
leave out can only be made on the basis of such an
allcomprising list. We recommend that developers carefully
consider every single aspect presented in [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
          ], as all of
these aspects have been formulated as modeling tasks or
as actual information needs in clinical praxis.
