      <abstract>
        <p>Business networking relies on application-specific quantity and quality of information in order to support social infrastructures in, e.g., energy allocation coordinated by smart grids, healthcare services with electronic health records, traffic management with personal sensors, RFID in retail and logistics, or integration of individuals' social network information into good, services, and rescue operations. Due to the increasing reliance of networking applications on sharing ICT services, dependencies threaten privacy, security, and reliability of information and, thus, innovative business applications in smart societies. Resilience is becoming a new security approach, since it takes dependencies into account and aims at achieving equilibriums in case of opposite requirements. This special issue on 'Security and Privacy in Business Networking' contributes to the journal 'Electronic Markets' by introducing a different view on achieving acceptable secure business networking applications in spite of threats due to covert channels. This view is on adapting resilience to enforcement of IT security in business networking applications. Our analysis shows that privacy is an evidence to measure and improve trustworthy relationships and reliable interactions between participants of business processes and their IT systems. The</p>

      <p>
        At present, one of the most promising visions for business
networking is the exploitation of information with information
and communication technology (ICT), in particular by Big
Data analytics with cyber-physical systems (CPS)
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref11 ref32 ref40">(acatech
2011; Wahlster and Müller 2013)</xref>
        . IBM calls it ‘Smarter
Planet’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">(IBM Corporation 2008)</xref>
        , the European Commission
(2010) has started the corresponding program ‘Horizon 2020—
A Digital Agenda for Europe’, and Japan proposes the
‘Declaration to be the World’s Most Advanced IT Nation’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet 2013)</xref>
        . One aim of
these initiatives is that systems, such as business networking
applications, social infrastructures, and a society become
resilient. Changes and vulnerabilities should be identified and
analyzed to foresee and prevent incidents of any kind, as well
as to react accordingly in acceptable time. Resilient ICT then
supports the increased, sustainable welfare of a society.
      </p>
      <p>The key approach for gaining information on
vulnerabilities and predicting incidents will be the ability to access and
to analyze huge amounts of data in nearly real-time and to
implement so-called Big Data analytics successfully. Service
providers will collect, aggregate, and analyze data from
various sources provided by CPS, e.g., business networks, social
networks, sensors and actuators, as well as governments and
citizens. Prominent examples for such innovative business
networking applications can be found, e.g., in the domain of
energy allocation coordinated by smart grids, healthcare
services with electronic records, traffic management with
personal sensors and interconnected vehicles, RFID in retail and
logistics, individualized manufacturing of goods, as well as
personalized services based on an individual’s social network.</p>
      <p>
        Such business networking applications share the Internet
and its ICT services for global communication. Due to the
increasing interdependence of the participating components,
incidents may result in highly disruptive impacts. Technical
failure, human error, accidents, or cyber-attacks might spread
via dependencies and could threaten security and reliability of
ICT services, the supported social infrastructures, and, in the
end, the welfare and safety of our society. In order to improve
the security and reliability of ICT support in this context,
several approaches are currently being discussed and
implemented. For example, the reform of the EU legal framework
for electronic communications added Article 13a addressing
security and reliability. It asks public and private service
providers to take security measures and provide an incident
report flow as an information exchange on vulnerabilities and
incidents between providers, national regulatory authorities,
the European Union Agency for Network and Information
Security (ENISA), and the European Commission. It is
proposed that a qualified independent body should audit this
information flow. The vision is that such an information
exchange of incident reports would safeguard competition
and boost consumer choice
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(European Commission 2009)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        For improving resilience, a spontaneous exchange of
information of acceptable quantity and quality lies at the core of
these approaches. While such extensive information exchange
and analysis can already be observed in business networking
applications
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">(Riemer et al. 2009)</xref>
        in the context of security and
reliability it is still in an early stage. However, it would enable
service providers to derive information on vulnerabilities and
incidents by means of a secondary use of data with machine
learning algorithms. In turn such information can be disclosed
to other participants, e.g. actuators, who decide and act on this
information to improve the security of their services and ICT.
On the whole, such service providers and their business
networking applications might be of high relevance for
improving resilience of critical infrastructures, the emerging CPS,
and future business networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, information exchange is also the basis for
dependencies between ICT systems—not only in the desired
way as realized in business networking applications, but also
by creating undesirable vulnerabilities and risks.
Unfortunately, not all dependencies of an ICT system can be
automatically detected
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">(Wang and Ju 2006)</xref>
        and, thus, they
threaten trustworthiness and participation in an information
exchange. Therefore, one key issue to be resolved for
exploiting the full potential of future business networking is
enforcing the individual security and privacy interests of all
participants to achieve an acceptable trustworthy information
exchange. This implies controlling the usage of information.

      <title>Information exchange and intermediaries</title>
      <p>
        In computer science trustworthy information exchange means
a reduction of vulnerabilities in the participating ICT systems
and their communication in order to reduce the effect of any
incident
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Avizienis et al. 2004)</xref>
        . It also means that participants
can formalize a security policy describing their individual
security interests and negotiate on an agreed-upon security
policy reflecting a compromise or equilibrium respectively
(Rannenber
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">g et al. 1999</xref>
        ). In such multilateral IT security
m od e l s p r ot e c t i o n g o a l s , l i ke a c co u n t a bi l i t y a n d
unobservability, become an important part of a ‘balanced’
security. Enforcing accountability and unobservability can
be technically achieved by encryption and authentication
schemes supporting pseudonymity, e.g. by identity
management
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Chaum 1985)</xref>
        or cryptographic key systems
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">(Pfitzmann
and Hansen 2010)</xref>
        . These approaches depend on
confidentiality and integrity of the private key, its accountability to the
given identity, and on integrity and consistency of a public key
exchange. Even though trusted runtime environments exist
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Asokan et al. 2013)</xref>
        , security of a cryptographic key
exchange without a trusted third party (TTP) has not yet been
demonstrated
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Freire et al. 2013)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Introducing a third party extends the direct communication
model of an information exchange. In practice, the role of a
third party acting as an intermediary for an information
exchange is manifold. Intermediaries take care of the security
and reliability of the communication and of current payments.
Successful examples are SWIFT and international clearing
systems
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Bons et al. 2012)</xref>
        . Intermediaries also establish
relationships between data providers and data consumers by
deriving information based on data collected with their consent.
Successful examples here are loyalty card programs in the
field of customer relationship management (CRM) or social
networks sites. Furthermore, intermediaries can contribute to
the usability of an information exchange to enforce the
participants’ individual security interests. Usability studies of
security tools, e.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">g. PGP (Whitten and Tygar 1999</xref>
        ), show that
their user interfaces and security concepts are too technical
and not intuitive with the result that, as observed in Germany,
over 70 % are willing to delegate responsibility for their
security to a TTP
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(DIVSI 2012)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Altogether, intermediaries in the role of TTP can be
expected to play an important role with respect to extensive
information exchange. However, they also represent a new
vulnerability. Since an intermediary is usually involved in
several information exchanges with different participants,
dependencies between the intermediary’s ICT system and
those of the other participants arise during run-time. Hence,
a TTP also can be the origin of a possible man-in-the-middle
attack with serious consequences for the information
exchange. According to Article 13a incident reports in 2013,
third party failure has a high impact. Most of the observed
incidents have their direct cause in system overload, power
cuts, and software bugs
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Dekker et al. 2013)</xref>
        . The IT security
report for Germany in 2011
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(BSI 2011)</xref>
        shows a trend from
direct attacks to indirect ones via dependencies to the affected
ICT system. The report forecasts an increase in attacks by
botnets, identity theft, security vulnerabilities, and malware.
SCADA, mobile communications, interfaces and storage
media, or Cloud Computing systems — all of which are
considered to be part of future CPS — show an increased risk
potential. A current study of Internet usage in Germany
indicates that these threats represent a real hurdle for information
exchange. A fear of misuse of personal data is the main reason
why the majority of the population in Germany refrains from
participating in Internet services
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(DIVSI 2012)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Intermediaries can be expected to play a central role in
future business networks in the context of providing privacy
and security. However, they have to be trusted and, in other
words, the less trust required, the better. Therefore, security
and privacy mechanisms with a focus on intermediaries and
their dependencies as origins of incidents are of interest for
exploiting an effective information exchange in business
networks. In respect of the realization of an incident report flow,
there is no incentive to provide vulnerability information or to
report incidents without adequate protection of the disclosed
information. For example, a participant reporting a breach of
confidentiality would be harmed twice: firstly by the incident
itself and secondly by a loss of reputation due to the leakage of
the confidential report.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>Security models and their enforcement</title>
      <p>
        The security approach to protect information once it has been
disclosed to a third party is isolation on the part of the third
party. Isolation means that exchanged information should not
come into contact with other information exchanges and that
the intermediary should not know what information is used in
the service or the purpose for which the service is being used
by its consumers
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">(Sonehara et al. 2011)</xref>
        . Thus, enforcement of
isolation means to implement a multilateral trust model to
enforce an equilibrium concerning the individual security
interests of the participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individual security interests can be enforced by different
security models as described in the following. At first, access
control models formalize isolation by information flow
control for a closed group of participants. Mandatory access
control (MAC) security models, e.g. Biba, Bell-LaPadula, or
the Chinese Wall Security Policy, are in widespread use
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">(Samarati and de Capitani di Vimercati 2001)</xref>
        . They model
information flow control to protect data by the use of labels
and a pre-defined order. The pre-defined order classifies data
and identity of authorized participants as subjects into access
classes and formalizes the properties on data access as
provisions according to the protection goals of confidentiality or
integrity, respectively. However, the protection goal
availability of information might not be achieved easily if a MAC
policy is deployed for a spontaneous information exchange:
the pre-defined order of the security policy would have to be
implemented for service providers, leading to confidentiality
of the data but also to a restriction of the availability of the
services. Hence, a security configuration based on MAC may
lead to an incident on availability of information.
      </p>
      <p>Discretionary access control (DAC) where authorizations
are granted to the identity of authorized service providers (data
consumers) and not according to a security class, is more
flexible. However, to date, DAC approaches are not precise
enough for a trustworthy spontaneous information exchange.
Granting access to data for given exchanges needs to define a
group or role for the participants. This, in turn, could grant
access to parties of an information exchange who are not
participating in it representing a vulnerability regarding
confidentiality and integrity of the information exchange.</p>
      <p>
        In contrast, the concept of distributed usage control specifies
the confidentiality and integrity of an information exchange
and, thus, information flows as data processing by obligations
without restricting availability of information
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">(Pretschner et al.
2006)</xref>
        . The classification of
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">Hilty et al. (2005)</xref>
        for obligations
according to time and distribution shows that obligations are in
general not enforceable but can become so at runtime.
      </p>
      <p>Concluding, an instance of a security model for a given
isolation formalizes access on data and information, which is
mapped to the identities of authorized subjects. According to
the security model, security and privacy would be achieved if
only authorized identities get access to the information as
specified by provisions and obligations of the corresponding
security policy and if these identities did in fact represent the
corresponding data consumers. Their enforcement is to
prevent incidents and to close vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>
        A further relevant issue for realizing a trustworthy
information exchange is the authenticity of the exchanged
information. Authenticity of derived information is always subject
to a given error probability. Firstly, this is conceptually due to
application-dependent statistical model of machine learning
schemes
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Domingos 2012)</xref>
        . Secondly, information relates to a
given model, i.e. to a given context, e.g., described by service
level agreements and security policies specifying the context
of a data processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        At present, two opposing security concepts for enforcing
isolation are under discussion: transparency and control.
Transparency of data processing as stated by Information
Accountability
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">(Weitzner et al. 2008)</xref>
        follows the concept that
data processing should be observed and evaluated with
Transparency-Enhancing Technology (TET). TET aims at
identifying an incident and its cause in order to decide on
the accountability and trustworthiness of the affected
participant. In contrast, control on data processing as with Privacy by
Design
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(European Commission 2010)</xref>
        considers the
possibility of a violation of an isolation and aims at enforcing
unobservability. Privacy-Enhancing Technology (PET)
achieves at least unobservability by pseudonymity. For
selfprotection further PETs follow the approach of additionally
impeding secondary use of information and re-identification
of participants for purposes of data processing, which occur
after data collection. This may raise additional incidents and,
thus, requires transparency in their cause and origin to decide
on trustworthiness of the participants.
      </p>
      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>TET and dependencies</title>
        <p>
          TET aims at enforcing obligations for isolation by observing
the current data processing and its compliance to a given
security policy. If a policy violation occurs, an anomaly and
its cause are analyzed to decide on accountability. It can
establish whether the received information has been processed
according to the corresponding security policy. A monitor
observes data processing of an ICT system and logs it for a
data protection audit
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">(Karjoth et al. 2002)</xref>
          . If enforcement of
isolation of previous information exchanges and
vulnerabilities of the ICT system of the data consumer are known, a data
provider then can derive information about expected
enforcement of isolation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data leakage prevention aims at confidentiality of data
processing. However, a monitor cannot consider more than
one trace and is vulnerable to covert channels as seen by
virtualization in Cloud Computing
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">(Ristenpart et al. 2009)</xref>
          .
This is an example of the vulnerability of data confidentiality
via a dependency even though the service provider grants
access to his services to authorized identities only. If
confidentiality is not the highest priority for an information
exchange but rather integrity, consensus protocols are an
approach to tolerate incidents while resulting in a consensus of
authentic information. Preferably different implementations of
the same information exchange run in parallel. Consensus
protocols assume an information exchange also between these
implementations, e.g. by an unknown, inevitable dependency.
However, it is impossible for consensus protocols to result in a
consensus in the asynchronous timing model, if only one of
the participating systems fails during the protocol run
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Fischer
et al. 1985)</xref>
          . Adding extensions such as randomization, failure
detectors, or strong primitives for shared-memory lead to
consensus protocols coping with failed systems due to delayed
or failed data transfer but not for malicious incidents. This is
the case with timing restrictin
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">g consensus protocols (Gärtner
1999</xref>
          ). Consensus protocols for a synchronous model cope
with failed systems up to a certain number of compromised
ICT systems, even if they send different messages to other
systems
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">(Pfitzmann and Waidner 1992)</xref>
          . However, they
restrict availability of the participating ICT systems. This is a
vulnerability for any other information exchange with a
dependency on this ICT system and out of the scope of the threat
model of consensus protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
          Latest research approaches aim at retaining detected
anomalies by evidence on the current model of data processing. That
means they reconstruct the current model but without restricting
availability. Secure logging and evidence
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">(Sackmann et al.
2006)</xref>
          consider transparent data processing of separated ICT
systems and restrict access to logged data to authorized
identities only. Process mining
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">(Van der Aalst 2012)</xref>
          extends
monitoring of the activities of an information exchange between ICT
systems. The assumptions are completeness and authenticity of
logged events, whereas confidentiality of the logged data in
accordance to granting access on these observations to
authorized identities is assured
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Accorsi 2011)</xref>
          . A variation of process
mining is data provenance, which also documents the history of
data and additionally their value by ‘sticking’ it to the data and
derived information
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Buneman et al. 2001)</xref>
          . Schemes are
inversion of data processing and annotation of data. Inversion
depends on knowledge of the granted access decisions and the
output data. This relates to the same completeness assumption
as for secure logging and process mining. Annotation labels
data so that the model of data processing can be re-constructed
if a mapping to the data exists. However, current means for data
provenance by annotation either assume centralized monitoring
of the complete information exchange or are suitable for some
kind of data without the derived information. Furthermore, data
provenance can detect an information leakage and its cause
only if the leaked information has been found together with
evidence on its history
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">(Wohlgemuth et al. 2010)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>Data provenance and secure logging as a components for
each ICT system under investigation can in principle be used to
check the integrity and origin of information by the reconstructed
model and its comparison to the security policy. This
reconstructed model in turn should extend the model of the applied
machine learning scheme. In order to detect an identity theft, it
may not be sufficient to reconstruct the model of this data
processing, since it ends at the identity. It may also be necessary
to check whether an anomaly in the usage of this identity exists
regarding the information exchange under investigation.</p>

        <title>PET and dependencies</title>
        <p>
          After converting obligations into provisions, PET enforces
them while considering violations of confidentiality of
isolation. The assumption is an idealized threat model assuming
ICT systems as being correct whereas trustworthiness of
participants is uncertain. PET impedes re-identification,
secondary use, and non-authorized profiling according to the
master identity of a participating party. It can be achieved by
restricting availability of information or the information itself
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Gilliot et al. 2009)</xref>
          . This, in turn, threatens Big Data analytics
with an increase of its error probability by introducing faulty
information or the non-availability of sufficient quantity,
whereas this does not depend on the type of machine learning
scheme

          Encryption protects information before access has taken
place. However, after decryption, protection is no longer
provided and information can be leaked via an unknown
dependency. Identity management with anonymized
credentials achieves accountability and unobservability as long as
further disclosure to third parties is not considered

          . A non-linkable delegation
of rights achieves unobservability and accountability in an
information exchange with an intermediary under the
assumption that the modeled recipient of the information as the last
data consumer in its exchange is trustworthy and its ICT
system has no vulnerability
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31 ref44">(Wohlgemuth and Müller 2006)</xref>

However, this is not realistic for a spontaneous information
exchange with an intermediary.

        <p>Our analysis of dependencies in a spontaneous information
exchange and today’s mechanisms to enforce its security model
in accordance with the security and privacy interests of the
participants shows that an incident and its propagation to a
secure ICT system is always possible. On one hand, it is possible
that an attacker can control the identity of this participant. On the
other hand, strengthening transparency by consensus protocols
or confidentiality by PET with reducing the information raises
an incident on dependent information exchanges.</p>

      <title>Resilience as an approach for IT security and privacy</title>
      <p>At present security and privacy in business networking is based
on a system and threat model, which includes a limited set of
possible information exchanges and incidents. It considers
expected states and dependencies including those, which have
already passed. A partial model can be achieved for any
subsystem, which does not change for an adequate time. However,
this is not reality for many actual business networking
applications which are highly dynamic and agile. Since vulnerabilities
from dependencies arise during run-time and cannot be
completely known and predicted, the ‘pure’ model-based
approach is not adequate for preventing and reacting in this
context. It is not (at least not efficiently) possible to model all
possible changes and incidents and, thus, security with ‘pure’
model-based approaches will have to follow changes in
business networks and their underlying technology.</p>
      <p>
        Extending ‘pure’ model-based security and privacy
approaches to the dynamic and unforeseeable context of actual
business networking means having to address these
vulnerabilities and dependencies. The general view then changes from
achieving ‘pure’ security to preserving an acceptable level of
service of a system that corresponds to a compromise of the
individual security and privacy interests of the participants in an
information exchange. Preserving an acceptable level of service
of a system requires constantly adapting its dependencies to
incidents
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">(Holling 2001)</xref>
        , a concept that is also known as
resilience. However, a general statement on the resilience of a
system cannot be made. It corresponds to a certain incident and
the ability of a system to recover within a certain time for
response and composite costs and risks
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(Haimes 2009)</xref>
        . Since
neither individual security and privacy interests (and
compromises) nor vulnerabilities remain identical over time, an
adaption of security and privacy enforcement is required.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, it is worth thinking about improving security and
privacy in business networking by using methods and tools
that support resilience of social infrastructures, i.e. in
particular Big Data analytics and information exchange on incidents.
For data providers and data consumers approaches are
required that allow both to balance the benefit and the level of
service, respectively, the security or privacy risk associated
with information exchange. This means that, e.g., a data
provider should be able to check before an information
exchange takes place whether a data consumer might violate
obligations for the information exchange. Vice versa, a data
consumer should be able to check a priori of an information
exchange whether the received information is the expected
one and the data provider has followed the agreed-upon
security policy for this information exchange. From an
economic theory point of view, this leads to an asymmetric
information situation that can usually be solved (or at least
improved) by signalling or screening mechanisms
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Furubotn
and Richter 2005)</xref>
        . Thus, new technical approaches that
address the reduction of information asymmetry are being
discussed as suitable methods and tools for improving security
and privacy in business networking.
      </p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>ICT Resilience — a signaling and screening architecture</title>
        <p>To empower data providers and data consumers to assess and
balance the benefit and risk of entering an information
exchange, classical security methods and tools should be
complemented by methods and tools that support their decision
making. To reduce information asymmetry, signalling
components should give a participant a tool to generate evidence on
his actual data usage to prove trustworthiness according to the
corresponding obligations, as well as establish a reputation over
several information exchanges. In turn, a screening component
should give a participant a tool to prove that exchanged
information has been used as intended (or not). These tools are to be
combined with accountability and an (economic) incentive
system that allows each participant to evaluate the value of an
information exchange according to the security configuration,
the achievable level of, e.g. unobservability or accountability,
and individual risk preferences.</p>
        <p>In accordance with our analysis and adapting current
approaches for resilience to security and privacy in business
networking, we use the following five components to
categorize methods and tools, as well as open research issues for ICT
Resilience.
&amp; A Usage Control Policy Tool Box aims at formalizing
isolation patterns for expected information exchanges
and anti-isolation patterns for classes of anomalies of an
isolation. On one hand, this is required for expressing the
interest of the parties involved in an information
exchange. On the other hand, this is a basis for detecting
anomalies, incidents, and policy violations, as well as for
generating correct incident reports and their exchange.
The set of patterns should be extensible to cater for newly
detected patterns during runtime and for previously
unknown interferences and results.
&amp; Privacy Control aims at self-protecting against
information leakage. The real identities of data providers should
remain unobservable when information is going to be
disclosed to third parties. This requires, e.g., identity
management supporting pseudonymity and non-linkable
delegation of rights. Pseudonymity should be revocable in
case of provable fraud.
&amp; Privacy Forensics aims at deriving evidence on isolation
by the most probable data processing including its
dependencies and its classification to an anomaly pattern. A data
provenance scheme could derive such evidence. However,
since internal dependencies of an external ICT system are
usually not known, supervised machine learning in
combination with labeled evidence could be useful for
deriving the probabilities of possible information exchange.
Since not all kind of data can be annotated, mechanisms
of unsupervised machine learning should also be
researched according to their suitability.
&amp; IT Risk Analysis aims at evaluating and combining both
types of evidence to result in a qualitative (or quantitative)
statement on isolation, on information exchanges and, thus,
on security and privacy in the corresponding business
networking application. This component should consider
results from, e.g., the Big Data analytics and information
exchange on incidents. Based on the results of the risk
analysis, an information exchange can be balanced, i.e. the
corresponding security policies and compromises can be
decided according to all the participants’ risk preferences.
&amp;</p>

      <sec id="sec-4-2">
        <title>System Evolution aims at automatic improvement of the</title>
        <p>security configuration for an isolation and replacement of
compromised ICT systems or participants, respectively. A
removal of systems implies revocation of rights, which can
be, e.g. realized by revocation mechanisms for credentials.
In the case of accessed data, information has to be removed
along the subsequent data trace or at least made useless.
Data provenance and data mining technologies can support
auditing whether this information has indeed been removed.</p>
        <p>We do not wish to claim that these five components are the
silver bullet to achieving ICT Resilience, however, we expect
that they can provide an initial categorization for topics that
address security and privacy in future business networking.
Summarizing, an ICT system providing a
signaling-andscreening architecture of ICT Resilience is by itself a business
networking application in providing ‘security-as-a-service’
with all its dependencies, vulnerabilities, and possibilities to
violate the privacy interests of data providers. Since security
and privacy cannot be guaranteed by technology alone, other
means should foster the participation of individuals and
correctness of their data and services. Data protection acts
combined with adequate incentives are one option, however, they
require reliable methods and tools for signaling and screening
of actual behavior of all participants without harming their
privacy and security interests. We see the challenges as
interesting areas for research and finding solutions as a prerequisite
for exploiting the potential of business networking
applications relying on extensive data processing.</p>

        <title>Papers within ICT Resilience</title>
        <p>All papers of this special issue contribute to one of the
presented components of ICT Resilience. Dehling and Sunyaev
(‘Secure provision of Patient-Centered Health Information
Technology Services in Public Networks—Leveraging
Security and Privacy Features Provided by the German
Nationwide Health Information Technology Infrastructure’)
address the component Usage Control Policy Toolbox. They
investigate security and privacy in business networking using
the example of patient-centered health ICT services (PHS)
based on the German infrastructure gematik. They identify
security and privacy requirements of PHS, which could serve
as a starting point for specifying isolation patterns for an
information exchange of patients’ health data between
medical service providers and third parties.</p>
        <p>Gogoulos, Antonakopoulou, Lioudakis, Mousas,
Kaklamani, and Venieris (‘On the design of a privacy aware
authorization engine for collaborative environment’) also
address the component Usage Control Policy Toolbox with a
proposal for enforcing isolation of cross-organization
information exchanges. Their authorization engine derives
authorizations for data processing from a semantic model in
accordance with the privacy and security interests of the
participants.</p>
        <p>Kieseberg, Schrittwieser, Mulazzani, Echizen, and Weippl
(‘An algorithm for collusion-resistant anonymization and
fingerprinting of sensitive microdata’) refer to Privacy Forensics
in case of the disclosure of anonymized information to third
parties. They present a k-anonymization scheme, which tags
anonymized information by the procedure of their
anonymization. Their evaluation considers colluding data
consumers with the aim of non-authorized re-identification
of the related identity to this information.</p>
        <p>Rechert, von Suchodoletz, and Valizada (‘Take Care of
Your Belongings Today—Securing Accessibility to
Complex Electronic Business Processes’) address
accessibility of information for the purpose of keeping business
processes resilient. Since the outcome and costs of reconstructing
archived information with the configuration of the
corresponding instance of a business process are difficult to
estimate, their proposal is to emulate their reconstruction in
possible future data processing environments using software.
The aim is to identify clearly defined and controllable
preservation strategies, which should be integrated in current
business processes. This forecasting and emulation approach is
one option for supporting the continuous learning of isolation
and anti-isolation patterns for IT Risk Analysis.</p>
