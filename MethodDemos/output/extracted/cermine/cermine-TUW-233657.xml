      <abstract>
        <p>-Recent research in Visualization has focused mostly on data analysis systems for domain experts, but also considered presentation to external people in the form of storytelling. The established directions assume that the target audience has in inherent interest in the facts to be discovered, sometimes even to the point of them being willing to learn how to operate a complex visualization system and spend considerable time and effort. In reality, sometimes the opposite is true: people unwilling to face an inconvenient truth actively avert their eyes. As a solution, we propose the presentation of facts by experts who manage to gain a limited amount of attention by means of rapid and expressive visualization. Using conventional desktop systems, this method is hard to implement, but new visual channels will open up new possibilities.</p>

      <title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>
        In 1997, Edward Tufte argued that the catastrophic loss of the space
shuttle Challenger can be traced back to the engineers who argued for
postponing the launch, but failed to convince the officials at NASA
[13]. Even though his argument was subject to criticism later [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ], the
critics refrain “to say that the engineers presentation was not flawed
or that even if conceptually correct, could not have been better done”
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ]. Both publications are several years old by now, and in the
meantime, the science of Visual Analytics has emerged that might have
allowed the engineers to gain a much better understanding of their
data. Afterward, they might, at best, have made a screenshot from
their Visual Analytics system and send that to NASA—active analysis
by experts has improved much, but for convincing others, research has
stalled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically, what Tufte does [13] is nothing else but storytelling [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ]
which has seen a considerable amount of practical research and is
praised as a tool for reporters in writing articles. However, those
visualizations are still aimed at people of have an active interest in getting
information about a topic. The officials at NASA most likely had a
high interest of launching the Challenger, and there was only little time
to convince them with one or two highly impressive visualizations.
      </p>
      <p>In this workshop paper, our intent are to
1. analyze the task of convincing other people by a visualization
rather than a lengthy discussion;
2. explain how the emergence of non-desktop (or rather console)
computer usage helps in that task; and
3. lay out the prospects for the future.</p>
      <p>
        In Section 2, we show what has already been done. In Section 3 we
describe three scenarios of a possible future. Finally, in Section 4,
we estimate which research is necessary right now to make this future
come true.
2
As already mentioned in Section 1, Tufte [13] describes the
example of the catastrophic loss of the space shuttle Challenger. The
engineers presented a complex setup of various information tables and
pictograms that lead to information overload for the decision makers.
Given they had known better themselves [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ], they could have shown
a simple scatterplot as proposed by Tufte [13], to spark the right
decision, postponing the launch, in one single visualization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kosara and Mackinlay [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ] pick up the concept of storytelling, which
is arguably the same thing Tufte [13] does in the Challenger example.
In their paper [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ], the authors consider several scenarios we intend to
do here, but they (1) underestimate the case of an adverse target and (2)
mostly discuss conventional presentations that are planned in advance
and held in front of an audience, with hardware that usually is a video
projector and not a desktop system, but, actually, the joint scion of the
desktop and the overhead projector which faced critizism even before
the decline of the desktop [13].
      </p>
      <p>
        To support storytelling in presentations, Lee et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ] present
SketchStory, a system that lets presenters sketch visualizations that,
by application of gesture detection, generates visualizations of real
data from the sketches. Storytelling in journalism is the focus on a
paper by Segel et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ]. Usually, storytelling is seen as any form of
visualization sequences. Robertson et al. focus on storytelling using
one animated visualization, which can be seen as a special case of the
general storytelling [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        Bateman et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ] argue that depending on situation, the guidelines
proposed by Tufte [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
        ] might be detrimental to the deeper cause: while
it is important for users to clearly understand the information, design
choices that do not immediately transfer information (like including
pictures) might still help remembering visualizations, which is
important for some of the scenarios we will show in Section 3.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kim et al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ] evaluate that “iconic and metaphorical images
triggered more awareness and motivation for future behavior change
through emotional attachment, while indexical representation was
good for informative and retrospective purposes”, thus backing up the
concept of storytelling. They root their work in persuasive systems [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ],
which are also related to our course, but most of it is a bit further from
Visual Analytics. Chih and Parker [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ], on the other hand, use
Visualization for persuasion and give several examples how to do it. They
are, however, proposing methods that might be subject to criticism by
persons who consider them misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
        To sum up the state of the art in storytelling, much work has already
been done to deal with the situation that people are lacking the time or
interest in important information. To some degree, it is even helpful for
information that people are discontent with and therefore are
subconsciously fading it out. An example application for such inconvenient
truths has been described by Munzner in her famous panel contribution
at VisWeek 2008 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ]. She describes “total political transparency” as
“InfoVis outwards grand challenge” [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ]. The recent advances in
storytelling presented above can definitely fulfill some of the requirements
for this challenge, but not all of them. While there no current
publication on the progress by the team around Munzner on that matter, we
think that our scenarios deal with situations that include an increase in
political transparency, so we hope for mutual benefits in the future.
      </p>
      <p>Even the problem of an unwilling audience, is, however, magnified
if things happen quickly and possibley in the heat of a discussion. It
is still easier to reason with a person reading a column or listing to
a speech than convincing it during a discussion with the audience, or
with a third person who contradicts. In our scenarios, we will hint a
better future for all three cases.

      <title>SCENARIOS</title>
      <p>Heading the call of the workshop, in this section we will switch from
the normal scientific writing style to novel-style prose. The discussion
from a scientific point of view will be done in Section 4.
3.1</p>
      <p>A Day at the Office
“This variant is not part of our product line”, explained Broderick
Wyke to his office manager Elsy Kader. Naturally, she was familiar
with the products of the company and the sales strategy. The
problem was that the strategy partly missed the customer requirements,
and they kept phoning about the variant she just had proposed. The
course of events was the same every time: the customers described
their problem, she acknowledged it, and manually filed the process
into the system. Unless an intern happened to be at the phone, then the
whole process got more complicated again. Moreover, the demand of
the customers had even shifted over the last time. However, she was
aware that Wyke took personal pride in his product palette. She needed
to make her argument good. Luckily, she had installed her
state-ofthe-art visualization app on her phone. Connecting to the sales data
of the local network was a matter of seconds, as was selecting a
sensible default for the visualization. She directed the internal projector
at the next wall: “Here is a list of customer inquiries, you see the
decline of the conventional palette, paralleled by an increasing demand
of custom orders that can be grouped to. . . ”—tap—“. . . this. Looking
at the state of the last quarter aggregated, the distribution is like. . . ”—
tap—“. . . this.” For several minuted it was silent in the office. She
started to hear her heart beating. Finally, Wyke took a deep breath and
responded: “Ok, perhaps the customer requirements have shifted. I
will device a new product palette ASAP.” While he was leaving, Elsy
sighed. He would, of course, return with her proposal, believe to have
done it himself, and be proud of it. Visualization could do a great deal
to solve problems. It couldn’t change people from the scratch. Yet.
3.2</p>
      <p>“Working Sucks”
Galen Grippen was a bit at unease. The financial sanctioning for
unemployed people who showed to be “unwilling of being reintegrated”
were to be tightened. He was not afraid of being unemployed, with
long successful record as an economic consultant, but this was not
about his personal situation. He was sitting on TV to prevent it—to
help other people, and to fight for a free job market. However, things
were going badly. “I am aware that regrettable cases exist when
people where unduly sanctioned. However, those people have all received
rightful legislation by now. Thus, we need to sanction people who
actively impede getting into a job.” After Hunter Wynn, president of
the employer’s federation was finished with his speech, the
moderator asked “But what do the concerned people really think about this,
what is your opinion?” The unemployed who was sitting in the
talkshow responded: “Working sucks. I guess I will just find another way
around the sanctions.” Galen gasped. He had worked long to build up
a lobby for unemployed people. He had talked to hundreds of them, to
the least. It was just unfair that now as he was sitting here to publicly
impeach the hardships of further sanctions against unemployed
people, he had to face not only a professional opposing him, but also the
concerned person in the round practically against him. He was pretty
certain that strings had been pulled in the background to achieve this,
but for the sake of keeping the public opinion at the truth, he needed a
solution, and he needed it fast. In that moment, the moderator was
asking a question to him, already trying to shift the topic forward, so he
knew he had to make his move. He activated the wireless connection
between his phone and the video-in of the station. Since the freedom
of visualization act, everybody who was eligible to speak his or her
mind was also eligible to visualize it. “This is the number of sanction
cases over time”, he started, “but if we. . . ”—tap—“. . . separate this
into legitimate and illegitimate sanctions, we see that the illegitimate
sanctions decline fast while the legitimate sanctions decline slowly.
Of course, this means, that currently, most sanctions are legitimate,
but this also means that the systems works—we do not need to change
it. Moreover, if we purge the aspect of people adjusting to new
regulations from the data, we have. . . ”—tap—“. . . an almost constant line.
I would have liked to assign this to people, because that would have
shown that a number of people that, in my estimation is far below one
percent of the long-term unemployed people, is continuously lawfully
sanctioned. The others are playing by the rules, and the proposed
legislation would just induce another round of this: . . . ”—tap—“. . . Here
you see the time interval after the last aggravation of sanctions. Some
people I supported volunteered their data to me, and it shows that
employers tried to get the better of them. The results were those lawsuits,
when attorneys, paid by the state via lawsuit aid, won against the state,
resulting in a total cost you see. . . ”—tap—“. . . in this bar chart. The
bar next to that shows what it would have cost to just pay the people
their welfare aid ignoring the sanction. I made my point: this whole
thing just costs the tax payer a lot of money in order to punish a few
people.” He breathed again. That should at least have thwarted at least
this little scheme, even if the discussion would go on.
3.3</p>

    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>The Price of a Degree</title>
      <p>Merlin Stoyer organized his data. He intended to combine several sets
in order to assemble important information. One was a set of donations
of private persons to political parties. Another one was about owners
of company shares. A third one was about political decisions regarding
CO2 boundaries. Those datasets together already told a story: A
number of stakeholders from electricity companies had filed a larger
number of donations to the governing party. A week later, the prime
minister had loosened that laws governing petroleum and coal plants. As
a result, the shareholder had gained a considerable amount of money
from rising stocks. Sadly, Merlin knew that this story would not be
big in the news. It was too remote for people to consider, nothing that
concerned “their world”. Thus, he decided to break it down for them.
To do that, he needed to consider the current models of global
warming and calculate how much the additional exhaust would affect the
climate. He saw that considering profit from power stations, a
tremendous amount of money was gained from one degree of global
warming. Finally, he calculated the price people had to pay for one degree
by means of increased costs for things like cooling, water, and
supporting economic refugees. He realized that the price of a degree was
even manifolds higher than the gain from it. Armed with these
numbers, he could calculate what every citizen had to pay for this event,
what every shareholder got from it, and what the governing party got
from it. From that, he generated visualizations to show people which
amount of money they just payed to some shareholders, and to the
governing party—and which amount of money was lost in entropy. Of
course, that was polemicized, but it would definitively have stronger
reception than just providing some weak statement. Satisfied, he went
on for another thing. A friend of his, Lilliam Vangelos, had chosen
a different approach. She had developed a plugin that showed people
who bought things only who earned what from their money. People
would be surprised how the governing party gained from them buying
a new air conditioning, and those who clicked on the provided links
would further his reputation as exposure journalist.

    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>REQUIREMENTS</title>
      <p>As a matter of fact, the scenarios from Section 3 are more or less
loosely based on true events that happened in the real world. Sadly,
they did not have the happy endings in reality, and this might be the
fact because as of today, the technical and scientific requirements are
not fulfilled. However, by aiming for scenarios like the ones shown
above, we might be able to provide for a better future.</p>
      <p>
        The journalism-related scenario (Subsection 3.3) is perhaps the one
closest to existing research, like the one by Kosara and Mackinly [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ].
However, the way similar events are unfolding in the world of today
shows that journalists fail to spark enough interest in enough people
throughout the population. . We do not know for sure, but it seems
that people rely too much on media that supports their personal
beliefs, filtering away the rest. We believe that the already impressive
research of visualizing data in journalism needs to be pushed further.
However, for people to benefit from important methods like
interaction, they need to apply electronic readers. The trend from desktops
to mobile devices, like tablets, has (1) increased the acceptance of this
way of reading news as a whole and (2) provided are more unified user
environment compared to the rather divergent situation of people
sitting at their desktops and people holding physical paper. In addition
to the general research described above, specialized research for this
devices is necessary. However, this scenario shows that not only the
research aspect is important, but also social standards have to develop
with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The right for “freedom of visualization” (Subsection 3.2) goes
perhaps even further into social standards and politics, yet if it could be
implemented, it would provide a whole set of completely new channels
for visualization. Actually, the analogue variant of showing a printed
panel has become a staple of Austrian debate culture. However, the
method is abused sometimes to show wrong or misleading
information. This shows that the problem of truthfulness is important in
showing visualizations to a broad audience as much or even more so than
for exploratory visualizations. In his second degree on Business
Informatics, [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ] shows that an audience actually mistrusts visualizations
by now because they are aware of it being possibly misleading. Lying
with words seems to be less effective and more tolerated than with
visualizations. For us, this is not a problem, but a challenge, considering
that our interest as scientists has to be showing the unbiased truth. As
a matter of fact, the method is unpopular among journalists—which is
disappointing, as they could, given the experience, pick up the
visualization and analyze its truth, e.g. by calculating the lie factor. Anyhow,
Tufte’s Challenger examples [13] shows that with visualization,
complex yet important information can be communicated much better. As
many visualization researchers might agree, visualization is just
another form of saying things. Consequently, it seems logical to include
a right of visualization into the right of free speech. There might be
severe political and juristic ramifications though, as things like lying
with visualizations need to be tackled, as well as the question how big
the visual space a person can get is—after all, people sometimes try to
peak each other verbally as of today, so similar things might happen
visually. From a technical and education perspective, the scenario has a
campaigner (not a visualization expert) generating new visualizations
(however, most likely based on sensible defaults), in real-time.
      </p>
      <p>The first scenario (Subsection 3.1) is, from a hardware
point-ofview, not too far-fetched. Cellphones with integrated projectors do
already exist, yet they are not very successful. Beside limitations
regarding size and battery capacity, the main problem is a lack of
practical application. Here, visualization research could lead to a useful tool
that can be applied just as described in the scenario. Using a projector
for presentation is most likely superior to turning a small phone screen
around hoping for the other side to take a close enough look at it.</p>
      <p>What is generally missing in related work is how to deal with an
audience that is only willing to pay a limited amount of attention, which
would need one compelling visualization that could then be followed
possible by a longer story. Also, related work is focused on classic
“ex-cathedra presentation”, analysis using desktop systems, or
websites, which are partly viewed on desktops, but also on mobile devices.
What is missing, based on the current hardware state of the art, is using
a mobile device to show something to somebody, as well as convincing
others while collaborating in a big-screen environment. The difference
to classic collaboration is that the target might not only have a different
opinion, but be generally unwilling to collaborate at first.</p>
      <p>These kinds of visualization include a form of interaction that
integrates the classic visualization aspects of exploration and analysis
directly with presentation: the audience is actually interacting, but not
with the data, but with the presenter, who, in turn, has to relay the
interactions to the system. Currently, presentation is most frequently
applied a-posteriori, when exploration and analysis have been finished.
At the same time, the focus might shift to more classic visualization
types, like line charts or bar charts, as the visualizations must not be
too complicated for a random target to grasp immediately.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the community definitely needs to think about how to
teach outsiders the necessary basics to apply visualization tools
properly, because otherwise, what we develop will end up not being used.
This includes the fact that these people often have uses cases that are
partly different from the ones currently researched.

      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>We have identified a new task for visualization: the demonstration of
information to an audience that might be uninterested to unwilling. In
several scenarios, we have shown the importance of this task and
explained how new visualization devices and concepts can help this task
in comparison to classic desktop visualization. Based on those
scenarios, we have addressed a number of requirements that would need to
fulfilled for this scenarios to become true. However, the requirements
are no concrete research goals yet. It remains open which exact
research projects need to be conducted in order to get most out of this
new developments. We will definitely need to cooperate with
philosophers, jurists, political scientists, didactics, and others, for topics like
personal rights, rhetoric, and visual literacy.</p>
