      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>
        The last decade has seen a growth of interest in the phase transition for Boolean satisfiability
(SAT). The clausal version of this problem shows a sharp transition in the sense that,
as the density of clauses is increased, formulas abruptly change from being satisfiable to
being unsatisfiable at a critical threshold point. Numerous experimental studies have been
performed in the investigation of phase transition for different variants of SAT problems,
thus giving strong evidence that the location of the transition coincides with such instances
that are hard to solve. In the meantime, theoretical studies have been conducted in order to
better understand such transitions. Determining the nature of the phase transition (sharp
or coarse)1, locating it, determining a precise scaling window and better understanding
the structure of the space of solutions turn out to be very challenging tasks, which have
aroused a lot of interest in different communities, namely mathematics, computer science
and statistical physics
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(see e.g., Dubois, Monasson, Selman, &amp; Zecchina, 2001)</xref>
        . From a
computer science point of view, the success of the SAT problem is due to two features. The
problem SAT provides a framework in which problems within the complexity class NP can

        Following the previous studies conducted by

        as well as
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Chen
and Interian (2005)</xref>
        , we focus on formulas in conjunctive normal form having two quantifier
blocks, namely on formulas of the type ∀X∃Y ϕ(X, Y ), where X and Y denote distinct sets of
variables, and ϕ(X, Y ) is a conjunction of XOR-clauses. Moreover, any variable occurring in
ϕ(X, Y ) occurs in X or Y , i.e., the formula ∀X∃Y ϕ(X, Y ) is closed. The model has several
parameters. First we consider (a,e)-QXOR-formulas, which are such that each clause in ϕ
has exactly (a + e) variables, a from X and e from Y . The (a,e)-QXOR-SAT property is the
property for such a formula to be true. The second parameter is a pair (m, n) specifying the
number of variables in each quantifier block, i.e., in X and Y . The third parameter is L,
the number of clauses. To sum up, the generated formulas are of the form ∀X∃Y ϕ(X, Y ),
where X has m variables, Y has n variables, each clause in ϕ has a variables from X and e
from Y and there is a total number of L clauses in ϕ. We are interested in the probability
that a formula drawn at random uniformly out of this set of formulas is true as n tends to
infinity (Section 2). We prove that the nature of the phase transition (coarse or sharp) for
(a,e)-QXOR-SAT is governed by the number of existential variables occurring in each clause.
For e = 2 and any a ≥ 1, we prove in Section 3 that the (a,2)-QXOR-SAT has a coarse phase
transition. Moreover we give an expression of the distribution function of the threshold for
(a,2)-QXOR-SAT and we show how it is influenced by the different parameters of the model.
For e ≥ 3, we prove in Section 4 that (a,e)-QXOR-SAT has a sharp phase transition—thus
getting the first proof of a sharp threshold for a natural quantified satisfiability problem.
2. QXOR, XOR and the Maximal rank Property
In this section, we relate QXOR and XOR to the Maximal rank property. We start with some
definitions and notations.
      </p>
      <sec id="sec-1-1">
        <title>2.1 Notation</title>
        <p>An e-XOR-clause, C, is a linear equation over the finite field GF (2) using exactly e distinct
variables, C = ((x1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ xe) = ε) where ε = 0 or 1.</p>
        <p>An e-XOR-formula, ϕ, is a conjunction of not necessarily distinct e-XOR-clauses. A
truth assignment I is a mapping that assigns 0 or 1 to each variable in its domain, it satisfies
e
an XOR-clause C = ((x1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ xe) = ε) if and only if I(C) := X I(xi) mod 2 = ε and it
i=1
satisfies a formula ϕ if and only if it satisfies every clause in ϕ.</p>
        <p>We will denote by e-XOR-SAT the property for an e-XOR-formula of being satisfiable.
An (a,e)-QXOR-formula is a closed quantified formula of the following type
∀X∃Y ϕ(X, Y ),
where X and Y denote distinct set of variables, ϕ(X, Y ) is an (a + e)-XOR-formula such
that each clause contains exactly a variables from X and exactly e variables from Y . Such
a formula is true if, for every assignment to the variables X, there exists an assignment to
the variables Y , such that ϕ is true. Observe that, for closed formulas, the notions of truth
and satisfiability coincide. For this reason, we will use the two notions synonymously in the
following. We denote by (a,e)-QXOR-SAT the property for an (a,e)-QXOR-formula of being
true.</p>
        <p>Throughout the paper, we reserve m for the number of universal variables (resp. n for
the number of existential variables), and {x1, . . . , xm} (resp. {y1, . . . , yn}) denotes the set
of such variables. Note that there are</p>
        <p>
          N =
m
a
·
n

· 2
(1)
(a,e)-XOR-clauses. We consider random formulas ∀X∃Y ϕ(X, Y ) obtained by choosing
uniformly independently and with replacement L clauses from all the possible N
(a,e)-XORclauses. Using the terminology of
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Chen and Interian (2005)</xref>
          , these formulas correspond
to (a,e)-QXOR((m,n),L)-formulas. We are interested in estimating the probability that
a randomly chosen (a,e)-QXOR((m,n),L)-formula is true. We denote this probability by
Pr(m,n,L)((a,e)-QXOR-SAT), or shortly Pr((a,e)-QXOR-SAT) when no confusion can arise.
When restricted to the non-quantified case, e-XOR-SAT, i.e., when a=0, we omit the first
component in the subscript, thus discussing Prn,L(e-XOR-SAT), or shortly Pr(e-XOR-SAT).
        </p>
        <p>We will show that the behavior of the (a,e)-QXOR-SAT property is bounded from
above and below by two monotone properties, namely the e-XOR-SAT property and the
Maximal rank property. Experiments will suggest that the right parameter in order to study
these properties is c, the ratio of the number of clauses over the number of existential
variables. Moreover, according to the results obtained for e-XOR-SAT by Creignou, Daud´e, and
Dubois (2003), we know that the transition occurs when c &lt; 1. Therefore, in the sequel we
will always suppose without loss of generality that L ≤ n.
2.2 Upper and Lower Bounds for the QXOR-SAT Property
Note that a random (a,e)-QXOR((m,n),L)-formula can also be considered as the quantified
linear system
∀X∃Y (AX + EY = C)
(2)
with coefficient arithmetic in GF (2), where A (respectively E) is a matrix chosen uniformly
from the set of Boolean L × m (resp. L × n) matrices with exactly a (respectively e) units
in each row, and C is a Boolean column vector of dimension L chosen uniformly from the
set of all such vectors. Moreover, A, E and C are chosen independently.</p>
        <p>Observe that the quantified linear system
is consistent if and only if
∀X∃Y (AX + EY = C)
∀X (C − AX) ∈ Im(E),
where Im(E) represents the image of the linear application whose matrix representation is
E, that is Im(E) = {EY / Y ∈ {0, 1}n}. Hence the quantified linear system is consistent if
and only if C ∈ Im(E) and Im(A) ⊆ Im(E). Therefore, we get:</p>
        <p>Pr((a,e)-QXOR-SAT) =</p>
        <p>Pr(∀X∃Y (AX + EY = C) is consistent)
=</p>
        <p>Pr(C ∈ Im(E) and Im(A) ⊆ Im(E)).</p>
        <sec id="sec-1-1-1">
          <title>Thus, on the one hand</title>
          <p>Pr((a,e)-QXOR-SAT) ≤ Pr(C ∈ Im(E)) = Pr(e-XOR-SAT)
holds, and on the other hand, the inequality</p>
          <p>Pr((a,e)-QXOR-SAT) ≥ Pr(Im(E) = {0, 1}L)
holds. Therefore, if Prn,L(e-Max-rank) denotes the probability that a random matrix from
the set of L × n Boolean matrices with e units per row is of maximal rank, then for every
m ≥ a, all n and all L ≤ n, we get the following inequalities:</p>
          <p>Prn,L(e-Max-rank) ≤ Pr(m,n,L)((a,e)-QXOR-SAT) ≤ Prn,L(e-XOR-SAT).
(3)</p>
          <p>A natural question at this stage is to estimate the probability that a random matrix is
of maximal rank. In the following we will provide some experiments and theoretical results
comparing the behavior of the three properties, Maximal rank, QXOR-SAT and XOR-SAT,
thus making precise the behavior of the (a,e)-QXOR-SAT property according to the value
of e.
3. The Case e = 2
In this section, we restrict our attention to the case where all problems have two existential
variables in each clause (and the number of all variables is allowed to vary).</p>

drawing uniformly and independently) (1,2)-QXOR-formulas over 10 000 existential
variables and 10 000 universal variables with a ratio “number of clauses/number of existential
variables” varying from 0.1 to 1 in steps of 0.05 or 0.1. For each of the chosen values of
ratio, a sample of 1000 formulas were studied using the algorithm described in the work of
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">Creignou et al. (2001</xref>
          , chap. 6.4), thus deciding their truth (or satisfiability) as quantified
formulas. The proportion of true instances for each considered value of ratio has been
plotted in Figure 1. The same has been done for the other (a,2)-QXOR-SAT properties. Hence,
the different curves are independent from each other. For the 2-XOR-SAT experiment, we
used the same selection procedure over 10 000 existential variables. Again, Gaussian
elimination together with an examination of the quantifier structure were used to determine
the logical “status” (true or false) of every formula. Additionally, it has been computed
whether the matrix E has full rank or not. The curve 2-Max-rank shows the proportion
of systems with full rank and it corresponds to the 2-XOR-SAT curve in the same figure.
A close look at Figure 1 reveals that some points from the (a,2)-QXOR-SAT curves are
slightly below the (theoretical) lower bound given by the curve for 2-Max-rank. The reason
for this phenomenon is the independence of all the satisfiability curves from each other and
the “noise” induced by the finite sampling of problems. If we had chosen corresponding
problems with exactly the same existential part (and only the universal part varies), then
we would have got all satisfiability curves above the curve for 2-Max-rank.
        </p>
        <p>The experimental results shown in Figure 1 suggest first that the two bounding
properties, namely 2-Max-rank and 2-XOR-SAT are distinguishable, second that, when m = n, the
(a,2)-QXOR-SAT property coincides asymptotically with the 2-Max-rank property
independently of a ≥ 1, the number of universal variables per clause.</p>

        <p>At another scale for m, for instance when m is constant, the experimental results
reported in Figure 2 suggest that the (a,2)-QXOR-SAT property is in between the two
properties 2-Max-rank and 2-XOR-SAT.</p>
        <p>In the following, we will validate the conjectures suggested by these experiments and
prove that the property (a,2)-QXOR-SAT coincides asymptotically with the 2-Max-rank
property as soon as m is tending to infinity with n, and that it is in between the 2-Max-rank
property and the 2-XOR property when m is a fixed constant. In particular, we will make
clear the connection between random (a,2)-QXOR-formulas and random labelled graphs.
3.2 Bad Cycles and the (a,2)-QXOR-SAT Property
We are interested in the satisfiability of quantified systems of the form</p>
        <p>s = (∀X∃Y AX + EY = C),
where E (respectively A) is a matrix chosen uniformly in the set of Boolean L × n
(respectively L × m) matrices with exactly 2 (respectively a) units in each row, and C is a random
column vector of dimension L, in which 0 and 1 occur with the same probability. The
satisfiability of such a system is strongly related to the existence of cycles in graphs. Indeed, we
construct a graph Ga(s) with n vertices and L weighted edges. For each existential variable
yi we have a vertex in Ga(s). For each equation yi ⊕ yj = xi1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ xia ⊕ ε, we add the
edge {yi, yj } to Ga(s) with the label xi1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ xia ⊕ ε. A cycle is given by a sequence of
vertices (yi1 , . . . , yis ) such that for 1 ≤ j ≤ s − 1, {yij , yij+1} is an edge in the graph, and
so is {yis , yi1}. The cycle is said to be elementary if all the vertices in the sequence are
distinct. The weight of a cycle is the sum modulo 2 of the labels of its edges.
Example 3.1 Let X = {x1, x2, x3} and let Y = {y1, . . . , y7}. The formula ∀X∃Y ϕ(X, Y )
with ϕ(X, Y ) being a conjunction of the following equations

can be represented by the graph in Figure 3.</p>
        <p>In the following, we call a cycle bad when it has a nonzero weight, and good otherwise.
Example 3.2 In the graph associated with the formula described in the previous example,
there is a good cycle, (y1, y2, y6, y7), whose weight is 0, and a bad one, (y3, y4, y5), whose
weight is x2. For the latter cycle, the corresponding equations are y3 ⊕ y4 = x2 ⊕ 1, y3 ⊕ y5 =
x3, and y4 ⊕ y5 = x3 ⊕ 1. Adding these three equations yields the equation 0 = x2 which
cannot be satisfied because x2 ∈ X is universally quantified.</p>
        <p>
          For systems containing only existential variables, i.e., a = 0, it has been observed by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3 ref4">Creignou and Daud´e (2003)</xref>
          that a 2-XOR-formula is satisfiable if and only if the graph
G0(s) has no bad cycle, that is :
        </p>
        <p>Pr(2-XOR-SAT) = Pr(G0(s) has no bad cycle).
(4)
Using similar arguments, we get the following proposition.</p>
        <p>y3
Proposition 3.3 The system s is satisfiable if and only if Ga(s) does not contain any
elementary bad cycle, i.e.,</p>
        <p>Pr((a,2)-QXOR-SAT) = Pr(Ga(s) has no bad cycle).</p>
        <p>Proof: Suppose we have an elementary cycle with nonzero weight in Ga(s). Clearly, to
such a cycle corresponds a subsystem in s, for which there exists an assignment to X such
that no assignment to Y will satisfy it (see Example 3.2 for an illustration). Hence, s is
unsatisfiable.</p>
        <p>Conversely, suppose there is no (elementary) cycle with nonzero weight in Ga(s). Take
an arbitrary truth assignment I for the (universal) variables in X and apply it to Ga(s).
Since I(x) ∈ {0, 1} for all x ∈ X, the weight at each edge can be reduced to a constant
from {0, 1} by addition modulo 2. Moreover, since each cycle in Ga(s) has zero weight, the
corresponding cycle in the “reduced” version, G′a(s), of Ga(s) has also zero weight. The
graph G′a(s) corresponds to a system with existential quantifiers only.</p>
        <p>In order to obtain a satisfying truth assignment for the existential variables, it suffices to
apply the following procedure to each connected component of G′a(s). Consider an arbitrary
root vertex y and assign an arbitrary truth value v to it. We obtain a truth value for each
vertex in G′a(s) by performing a depth-first search starting from y. During the search, if
there is an edge (y′, y′′) labelled with ε and y′′ has no truth value yet, then we set the value
for y′′ to the value of y′ ⊕ ε. The assignment obtained in this way satisfies all the equations
since G′a(s) does not contain any cycle with nonzero weight.</p>

3.3 The Distribution Functions for 2-XOR-SAT and 2-Max-rank
In this section, we will give the exact asymptotical value of the bounds obtained in (3) in
terms of the order parameter c, where c · n is the number of clauses. For this we will use
well-known results from random graph theory.</p>
          <p>Let us recall that we consider the classical probabilistic model where each clause/edge
is chosen uniformly and independently among the</p>

            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Janson et al., 2000)</xref>
            , if we choose L = c · n
clauses, then this model is asymptotically equivalent to the one where each clause is drawn
independently with probability p, where
          </p>
          <p>c · n</p>
          <p>The corresponding probability is usually denoted by μp. However, for simplicity we will
keep the notation Pr.</p>

          <p>
            The asymptotic behavior of the number of cycles in random graphs has been first
investigated by
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">Erd˝os and R´enyi (1960)</xref>
            , and made precise by
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">Janson (1987)</xref>
            and
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">Tak´acs (1988)</xref>
            .
This number converges in distribution to a Poisson law of parameter λ, where λ is the limit
of the average number of cycles as n, the number of vertices, tends to infinity.
          </p>
          <p>This result can be easily extended to our model of labelled graphs. In particular,</p>

          <p>3.4 The Distribution Function for (a,2)-QXOR-SAT
The results obtained in the previous section, (6) and (7), together with the inequalities (3)
are sufficient to conclude that the (a,2)-QXOR-SAT property has a coarse phase transition
at the scale L = c · n and that its distribution function is in between the functions H0 and
H∞ described above. More precisely we get the following theorem.</p>
          <p>Theorem 3.4 For any integer a ≥ 1 and every c ≥ 0, let us consider
(a,2)-QXOR((m,n),cn)formulas consisting in the conjunction of c · n XOR-clauses, where each clause contains a
variables from a set of m universal variables, and e variables from a set of n existential
variables. Then, when n tends to infinity, the (a,2)-QXOR-SAT property has a coarse phase

Proof: The proof is based on Proposition 3.3 and, as discussed in the previous section, on
an estimation of the number of bad cycles in the labelled graphs associated with random
formulas.</p>
          <p>Let λm,a be the limit of the average number of bad cycles. We will give a closed
expression of λm,a. Observe that each label on the edges of the graph associated with a
(a,2)-QXOR((m,n),cn)-formula is formed with a constant, 0 or 1, and a “variable-label” made
of a universal variables. There are exactly ma such variable-labels, which are numbered
from 1 to ma . One can decide whether a cycle is good or bad according to the number
of 1 (even or odd) and the number of occurrences of each variable-label. Therefore it is
quite natural to associate to every cycle its length l, the sequence (N1, . . . , N m ) of the
( a )
numbers of occurrences of each variable-label, and the parity ε = 0 or 1 of the number of
occurrences of the constant 1. The limit of the average number of cycles whose parameter
(l, (N1, . . . , N(m)), ε) is fixed is

Moreover, from such a parameter (l, (N1, . . . , N(m)), ε), one can decide whether a cycle is
a
bad or not.</p>
          <p>For a better readability, let us focus on the case a = 1. In this particular case, the label
of an edge is of the form xi ⊕ ε, where ε = 0 or 1 and 1 ≤ i ≤ m. On the one hand, all cycles
of odd length are bad (for in the weight of such a cycle at least one of the coefficients of the
xi’s will be nonzero). On the other hand, there are two kinds of cycles of even length that
are bad. The ones in which the constant 1 appears an odd number of times, and the ones
in which one of the universal variables appears an odd number of times. Since, for m ≥ 1,
we have

It can be observed from the experimental results shown in Figure 8 that, contrary to what
has been observed in the previous section, the three smooth lines connecting the
consecutive points and corresponding to the transition of the three properties 3-Max-rank,
(a,3)-QXOR-SAT and 3-XOR-SAT are difficult to distinguish. Moreover, when n increases
(see Figure 9), the curves straighten and come closer one to each other, showing thus strong
empirical evidence that the transitions of the three properties coincide asymptotically, with
a sharp phase transition at the critical value c3 ≈ 0.918
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(which is the critical ratio for
3-XOR-SAT, see Dubois &amp; Mandler, 2002)</xref>
            . We will show that, for e ≥ 3, the introduction
of universal variables in XOR-formulas does not influence the sharp transition.
Theorem 4.1 For every e ≥ 3 and any integer a, the (a,e)-QXOR-SAT property has a
sharp threshold which coincides with the one of the e-XOR-SAT property.

      <p>
        We have (experimentally and theoretically) analyzed the phase transition for the quantified
problems (a,e)-QXOR-SAT. Our analysis has been conducted at the same level of
sophistication as the one made for the e-XOR-SAT problem, thus showing that the model proposed
by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">Chen and Interian (2005)</xref>
        is mathematically tangible and provides the good parameters
in order to perform a mathematical analysis of the phase transition for quantified problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the one hand, as observed for QSAT
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref11">(Gent &amp; Walsh, 1999; Chen &amp; Interian, 2005)</xref>
        ,
we have proved that the nature of the transition is not influenced by the introduction
of universal variables. On the other hand, in contrast with QSAT, we have proved that
the location of the phase transition—the critical ratio—is the same for the two properties
XOR-SAT and QXOR-SAT, and that the difference of behavior between these two properties
occurs at the level of the distribution function.
