        <p>Visual Analytics strongly emphasizes the importance of interaction. However, until now, interaction is only sparingly treated as subject matter on its own. How and why interactivity is beneficial to gain insight and make decisions is mostly left in the dark. Due to this lack of initial direction, it seems important to make further attempts in facilitating a deeper understanding of the concept of interactivity. Therefore, different perspectives towards interactivity are discussed and cognitive theories and models are investigated. The main aim of this paper is to broaden the view on interaction and spark further discussion towards a sound theoretical grounding for the field.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The Visual Analytics (VA) community is consistently stating
the value and importance of interaction for visual data
analysis. Despite this, empirical studies or theoretical models that
support these statements are scarce or missing at all. Until
now the value of interaction has largely been treated as a
minor issue in empirical studies. Nevertheless, it has mainly
been promoted by experts as valuable asset. “Interactivity”
and “interaction” are often used terms but concise definitions
are hardly ever given. From the perspective of media, we
might say that a paper map is static. But what if we cut and
fold the paper map? Isn’t that also interaction? And what if
we use a paper map to find a certain street? We are obviously
interacting with the world but where does the interactivity
reside? In our tools? In us human beings? Albeit it sounds easy
to define interactivity, the concept quickly becomes blurry.
VA experts state that interactivity is a powerful concept that
enables us to improve analytical reasoning in many ways.
Studies like [SNLD06] also provide some evidence for this
but research on describing why and how this is the case and
the mechanisms behind it, is largely missing. As Liu et al.
mention, “the field still lacks supporting, encompassing
theories” [LNS08]. Therefore, they call for cognitive theories
and models as the basis for research. This approach shall be
picked up in this paper: First, we will discuss the concept of
interactivity and its different facets. Second, cognitive
theories and models will be investigated. The aim of this paper
is to present different views on interaction and contribute to
the research towards a science of interaction.</p>

      <title>2. Related Work</title>
      <p>In the research and development agenda for VA [TC05] it
is claimed that current research too often focuses on the
visual representation rather than on the interaction design. A
science of interaction is called for that encompasses a
systematic examination of the design space as well as a
scientific theory and practice. Yi et al. analyzed prior research
regarding interaction task taxonomies in [YKSJ07] and
proposed a set of user intents guiding interaction. In [LNS08],
Liu et al. examined the postcognitivist theory of Distributed
Cognition and how it can be applied as theoretical
framework for Information Visualization. A rudimentary human
cognition model (HCM) is proposed in [GRF08] with the
aim of achieving a better understanding of the coordination
of human reasoning and interactive visual interfaces. Lam
proposes a framework for interaction costs [Lam08] in
analogy to Norman’s execution-evaluation cycle [Nor88]. Pike
et al. [PSCO09] aim to assess progress made since the
original call for a science of interaction in [TC05] and define
interaction challenges for the future. They report on the
application of Situated Cognition and Distributed Cognition
models. Recently, Liu and Stasko made an attempt to shed
light on the relationship between internal and external
representations and how interaction is related to these
representations [LS10]. In this context, the role of interaction is
mainly confined to external anchoring, information foraging,
and cognitive offloading. Dou et al. assess the possibility and
propose a framework for recording a user’s reasoning
process by capturing user interactions [DRC10]. Attempts to
develop models for interaction have been made in related areas
such as tabletop interfaces [SC06] or 3D interaction for
Scientific Visualization [Kee10]. This paper aims to contribute
to the research on interaction by broadening the theoretical
basis to areas that have partly not been covered yet.</p>

      <title>3. Interactivity</title>
      <p>In order to be able to grasp the concept of interactivity,
we follow the path of Stromer-Galley [Str04] who argues
that we have to tackle interactivity from two perspectives –
interactivity-as-product and interactivity-as-process. In the
first view, interactivity is seen as a property of the medium
itself, whereas in the second, interactivity is conceptualized
as intangible concept of a process. These two views shall be
used as starting points for further investigation.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>3.1. Interactivity-as-Product</title>
      <p>In the tradition of VA, interactivity is often seen as a property
of the tool in terms of the elements offered for user
interaction. According to Spence, “[i]nteraction between human
and computer is at the heart of modern information
visualization and for a single overriding reason: the enormous
benefit that can accrue from being able to change one’s view
of a corpus of data” [Spe07]. However, while the benefits
of being able to change one’s view are often stated, there
is hardly ever an explanation of what these benefits actually
are as well as how and why they work. Of particular
importance is the interaction style of direct manipulation.
According to [HHN85], a major point of importance of direct
manipulation is the fact that it gives a feeling of directness of
manipulation. Reducing the information processing distance
between the user’s intentions and the facilities provided by
the machine, makes the interface feel more direct by
reducing the effort required by the user to accomplish goals. It is
assumed that this feeling of directness results from the
commitment to fewer cognitive resources [HHN85]. From a
cognitive point of view, there are two main aspects of directness
– distance and engagement. Norman [Nor88] describes two
types of distances, which he termed gulf of execution and
gulf of evaluation, which are part of his execution-evaluation
cycle. Direct manipulation helps to bridge these gaps with
less effort. Engagement, the second main aspect of direct
manipulation, refers to “a feeling of first-personness, of
direct engagement with the objects that concern us” [HHN85].
This provides a feeling of control that is generally perceived
positively in contrast to communication with an
intermediary. Interactivity is not simply a yes/no property of a tool
or medium, but there are different degrees of interactivity
which are determined by the extent to which a user can
participate in modifying the visual representation [Ste92].</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>3.2. Interactivity-as-Process</title>
      <p>Not the features of a tool or medium are the concern of
interactivity-as-process, but the process of active discourse
of users with the data. Therefore, also the user’s tasks, goals
as well as the interaction context are taken into
consideration. The use of tools is deeply rooted in human development
and even precedes the use of language [KN06].
Postcognitivist theories mainly follow this approach and focus on the
process of interaction itself – activities of people using
technology. In traditional HCI, the more narrow view of
usersystem interaction is taken. While this attempt is much richer
with regard to including aspects related to users, the
interactivity of artifacts themselves is not an issue. In this sense,
also the process of visual perception can be considered as
interaction with the environment. Visual perception itself is
a dynamic process and does not work just like a digital
camera. Quite on the contrary, visual perception is a highly
dynamic process that is determined by many internal factors
such as attention, focus, or experience [War04].</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>3.3. The Value of Interactivity?</title>
      <p>Apart from investigating how interaction techniques work
and how interactivity can be modeled, it is important to
examine what users actually achieve by using interaction
techniques [LNS08]. This is a question that is quite hard to
answer. One possible explanation of the advantage of
interactivity is, that it reduces the cognitive load by enhancing the
expressiveness of the interface language (possible inputs and
outputs) and minimizing the gulfs of execution and
evaluation [HHN85] as already mentioned. Furthermore,
externalization of information is beneficial. Norman argues that
perceptual processing of external information is more efficient
than processing internally represented information.
Combining these two issues, interactive external representations can
be handled with ease largely on a perceptual and physical
manipulation level [Nor93]. Only recently, a small amount
of studies has focused on the value of interactivity. A study
on an interactive learning environment with varying degrees
of interactivity shows that there is a greater preference for
the interactive version [Ric06]. However, the study does not
indicate that better learning had been achieved when
interactivity was involved. In an insight-based study users preferred
inferior visualizations with interaction over superior
visualizations without interaction [SNLD06].</p>
      <p>After investigating interactivity, cognitive theories and
models will be assessed along their descriptive, evaluative, and
generative abilities for interaction.</p>

      <title>4. Cognitive Theories &amp; Models</title>
      <p>A central idea of cognitive science that emerged in the mid
1950s is that “[t]hinking can best be understood in terms of
representational structures in the mind and computational
procedures that operate on these structures.” [Tha96].
Different approaches towards cognitive science were developed
over the years: formal logic (inferences are made based on
statements); rules (IF-THEN statements); concepts (frame
application, cognitive scripts or frames that are getting
parameterized and instantiated); analogies (case-based
reasoning, adapting similar situations that are already familiar to
us); images (picture-like mental representations); and
connections (neural network of simple nodes and links).</p>
      <p>Computer science and especially HCI draw upon
cognitive science approaches to model the interaction
between humans and computers in so-called cognitive
architectures [Byr03]. Examples are Model Human
Processor (MHP), GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and
Selection rules), Cognitive Complexity Theory (CCT),
Collaborative Activation-based Production System (CAPS),
Soar, LICAI/CoLiDeS, Executive Process Interactive
Control (EPIC), and ACT-R 5.0. Almost all of the mentioned
frameworks are production rule systems that build upon
IFTHEN rules. Model Human Processor (MHP) [CNM83]
provides a framework resulting from a synthesis of the
literature on cognitive psychology and human performance up
to that time. It describes a system that is composed of
different types of memories and processors along with
performance measures that are grounded on empirical studies. In
MHP, the human mind is a specific type of an information
processing unit, which has three subsystems: the sensory
input subsystem, the central information processing
subsystem, and the motor output subsystem. GOMS (Goals,
Operations, Methods, and Selection rules) [CNM83] is an attempt
to provide a framework for task analysis, which describes
routine cognitive skills in terms of the four components –
goals, operations, methods, and selection rules. It describes
the hierarchical procedural knowledge a person must have to
successfully complete a task.</p>
      <p>The main points of criticism of the mentioned approaches
are that neither physical nor social environments are
recognized properly as cognitive science focuses on phenomena
inside the head of a single human being. Therefore, so-called
“postcognitivist theories” were developed that take these
external factors into account.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-8">
      <title>4.1. Postcognitivist Theories</title>
      <p>Artifacts are of special interest because computer tools can
be seen as cognitive artifacts for external cognition that
expand human capabilities [Nor93]. Their use not only affects
the individual but also social interactions. The role of
artifacts and social environments is emphasized in the
theories like Situated Action, Distributed Cognition, and
Activity Theory. Suchman [Suc87] challenged the assumption that
human cognition can be modeled in a computer program and
introduced a new theory of Situated Action. Here, human
beings are seen as thinking through interaction with the world
rather than by means of representing it and processing these
representations internally – the individual’s actions are
influenced by the context of their specific situation. It builds upon
the concept that the specific situation is the most important
factor in determining what people will do.</p>
      <p>Distributed Cognition largely originated from the work
of Hutchins and colleagues [Hut96]. “Cognition is said to
be “distributed”, meaning that it occurs not just in
individual minds but through the cooperation of many
individuals” [Tha96]. People, tools, systems, etc. are all “media”
and part of a system of nodes while human and nonhuman
nodes are of the same type. Structures inside the human body
as well as outside of it are part of the same cognitive
system and treated equally. This means that knowledge is not
only represented in the brains of individuals but also in the
artifacts we are utilizing. Distributed Cognition also deals
with the question of what transformations these structures
undergo. In contrast to the Situated Action approach,
Distributed Cognition emphasizes not the individual level but
the cognitive system as a whole. A central tenet of Situated
Action as well as Distributed Cognition is embodiment and
embodied interaction. Dourish describes it as “the creation,
manipulation, and sharing of meaning through engaged
interaction with artifacts” [Dou01]. Another major element
of Distributed Cognition is to understand the coordination
among individuals and artifacts, that is, to understand how
individual agents align and share within a distributed
process. Thus, it is of particular interest when dealing with
interactivity. This led to a first attempt to adopt Distributed
Cognition as the underlying theory for interactive
visualization in [LNS08].</p>
      <p>Activity Theory distinguishes clearly between individual
human beings and things. Moreover, a cornerstone of
Activity Theory is that people deliberately commit certain acts
by using certain technologies. This is at odds with the
Distributed Cognition theory where both, people and artifacts
are types of “media” in a system of nodes. However,
Distributed Cognition takes both points of view throughout the
work of [Hut96] – that of tool mediation and human
performance which clearly separates humans and tools, as well as
that of a cognitive system of like nodes. Activity Theory is
an answer to both points of criticism of traditional
cognitive science by including a rich social matrix of people and
artifacts that grounds analysis. The unit of analysis in
Activity Theory is an activity which is composed of subject,
object, actions, and operations. The subject is a person or a
group that is engaged in an activity. The object is the
objective held by the subject. Actions are goal-oriented processes
that must be carried out in order to fulfill the objective and
actions might have operational aspects, which are low-level
processes we are not aware of most of the time.</p>

      <title>4.2. Summary &amp; Discussion</title>
      <p>A number of traditional cognitive science approaches as well
as postcognitivist theories and models were presented in the
last section. Activity Theory appears to be the most
encompassing theory but also the most complex one. In terms of
interactivity, traditional cognitive science focuses on
usersystem interaction and interaction itself is modeled mostly
as simple input and output channels. Postcognitivist theories
go beyond interaction between people and technology and
account for the objects in the world with which subjects are
interacting via technology in a social context.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>The goal of this paper was to shed light on the concept of
interactivity in the context of VA. Therefore, the central
aspect of interactivity was tackled first from the point of view
of research about interactivity itself and second, by
investigating different cognitive theories. However, interactivity
is not explicitly accounted for or modeled in these
theories. Following the very definition of VA as “the science
of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual
interfaces” [TC05] we can discern a focus on the aspect of
interactivity-as-process in the first part of the definition. But
the second part also hints towards the question of how the
analytical reasoning can be supported via interaction
concretely (interactivity-as-product). Putting it together, both
perspectives, reflecting a top-down as well as a bottom-up
view, are of particular importance and should be pursued in
parallel. Another major aspect in VA is the intertwinedness
of visual and automated analysis techniques that need to be
integrated seamlessly. Special considerations are necessary
to account for this also with regard to interaction. Apart from
this, it is also important to take on a user’s point of view
and investigate how analysts see the role and value of
interactivity. In a preliminary qualitative study we interviewed
professionals in the business intelligence community.
Surprisingly, we found that interactivity in visual methods is
relatively unknown among users. However, interactivity is
associated with supporting a deeper understanding of data
for making well-informed decisions. Next, we plan the
following concrete next steps: to investigate Activity Theory in
cooperation with cognitive science specialists in depth for
grounding interactivity from a theoretical point of view and
to conduct empirical studies on how interactive features are
used in which contexts and for which tasks as well as to
investigate the effects of different degrees of interactivity.
