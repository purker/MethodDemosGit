      <abstract>
        <p>This position paper describes a critical incident from an early AAL project related to the design decisions made about which features to include. In order to give the older users of a sensor-based telecare monitoring system more tangible value, a number of non-sensor-based interactive services were incorporated into the system which was installed in a residential facility. These services were chosen based on recommendations and input from older people. In the end though, many services were not used and actually contributed to the system being removed from residences.</p>

      <p>The system in question is a sensor-based system that uses
data from movement sensors, as well as sensors on
windows, doors and appliances to determine if a person is
moving in their living environment and so presumably
okay. If no movement is detected for a certain period of
time, an alarm is generated. The person being monitored
first gets a chance to cancel an alarm. If this is not done
within a certain time period, a designated family member,
professional carer or emergency service is notified. The
primary aim of the system is to provide older people with
additional security and to allow them to stay in their own
homes longer.</p>
      <p>The company developing the system is a small and medium
sized enterprise in a European country with nationalized
health care. The company had not previously worked in the
e-health or AAL area, but saw a good opportunity to
diversify into a promising new area. For this they were</p>
      <p>THE INCIDENT
The critical incident here is the decision about how to
decide which additional functions or services to include
during the development following the show home. The first
step was talking to people who came to the show home.
This was followed by a more formal evaluation through
discussions with small groups of older people at the show
home, moderated by a researcher experienced with working
with older people. Before the pilot phase, focus groups
were held by marketing specialists to allow the people who
were to be included in the pilot to choose functions. During
the design of the functions, meetings with experts,
including professional carers, were held, during which the
experts also suggested other services.</p>
      <p>In the end, few of the services included in the pilot phase
were used in practice, even though the final detailed design
of the version for the pilot came about through input of
older people and was supported by expert groups. A good
case in point was the shopping service that allowed people
to order groceries through the system and have these
delivered. Although it was one of the highest rated services
by older people when asked beforehand, in practice it was
never used. In reality, people who were new to the assisted
living facility enjoyed going shopping and the opportunity
it gave them to meet people. Furthermore they had more
reserves – day-to-day living was now less physically and
emotionally challenging than when they were in their own
home, since they were now in a smaller apartment and had
the additional security of a carer in the facility. Still, in the
final evaluation, some older people said they still thought
this service was a good idea and might use it in the future.
ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND THE INCIDENT
A number of assumptions lay behind the decision-making
process, mostly about the patients / older stakeholders:
It was implicitly assumed that people could articulate
what they wanted after seeing a prototype, even though
most did not have experience with this type of
technology.</p>
      <p>The team assumed people living on their own in their
own homes could predict which functions they would
need when they moved to an assisted living facility or
later in life.</p>
      <p>There was an assumption that people from 65-85 were
in principle a homogenous group, and that, by
including a large number of people in the age group,
the requirements could be reduced to a single set of
needs. For example, that the needs of people looking at
it for their homes were still relevant, even when the
target for installation was changed to assisted living
facilities.</p>
      <p>The team assumed it was possible to gain diverse input
from a show home and did not think about how people
who were motivated and able enough to visit a show
home in the first place might differ from ‘average’
people that age. At the very least, a certain amount of
mobility was required to answer the invitation to
participate.</p>
      <p>There were, however, also assumptions about the problem
space:</p>
      <p>There was an assumption that a pilot phase lasting nine
months in a new assisted living facility would be
sufficient to decide which functions are needed more
generally. Although the interim evaluation report of the
pilot recognized this would not be sufficient, there was
no budget available to extend the project.</p>
      <p>There was an assumption that the concerns about
usability and costs, expressed by residents at the start
of the pilot phase, were exaggerated and would go
away once they had used the system.

CONSEQUENCES
There were a number of consequences. In the end, they
contributed to the fact that the system was not successful
and is no longer available, even though it works technically.
Having a large number of services, many of which were not
considered useful, made the system harder to use. This may
have actually discouraged use – in the final evaluation,
some people specifically mentioned being overwhelmed by
the large number of services available. The chosen services
also did not encourage people to engage with the system.
The additional services also added complexity to the
development. For almost every service, one or more
additional partners were needed. This made the
coordination during the project development more complex,
and also made the company decide not to give the
individual partners direct access to the users. In the end, this
may have contributed to a less than optimal design of some
services.</p>
      <p>Due in part to the usability issues, the older users requested
that the systems be uninstalled at the end of the pilot phase.
Since the system used the television, having the system
meant an additional button press was necessary just to turn
on the TV, which didn’t make sense if they did not use or
did not feel able to use the services. As a result however,
the other features were also uninstalled – including those
providing security and features that made it easier to inform
and sign up residents for activities.</p>
      <p>In the end, everybody lost: the older people / residents did
not have additional security, the carers had to take more
time to check if people were okay and the company lost
money. Furthermore, as a result of these experiences, the
system was withdrawn from the market. This seems like a
shame, especially as the installations sold to a different
assisted living facility during the pilot phase are still
running now, and are used regularly by residents of that
facility.</p>
      <p>WHAT COULD BE DONE
There are a number of things that could be done.
Even though there was a large number of people involved at
the show home and the discussion groups, it may have been
worthwhile to compare the data from these people with
statistics about the general population. This was done by the
authors in retrospect and indicated that people who were
interested in and/or willing to go had more computer
experience and fewer disabilities than people in the target
age group more generally in that country at that time.
It could useful to have more project team members visiting
the assisted living facility more often during the pilot phase
to generate ideas. In fact, based on experiences providing
support, a technician suggested the idea of a service to call
the lift. This is now one of the most popular services in the
final version that is still running. During an interview later,
a developer mentioned that valuable input came from this
source in another project, as well.</p>
      <p>It would also have been beneficial in the data gathering
phase to include more people who were already living in an
assisted living environment, who could have given
information about longer-term needs. While there was an
attempt to do this, the people willing to help were more
tech-savvy than the other residents.</p>
      <p>
        Another important aspect to consider is whether to make
the system configurable. This would enable to people to
choose features that are relevant for them, and to remove
those they don’t use. Furthermore, the system would be
able to be changed over time to reflect the changing needs
of the individual users, with different services added, taken
away. Although this seems obvious with modern tablet
technology, it is still important to keep in mind that this
could also have effects on reliability [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ], which is the end
the primary goal. At the very least, it requires additional
testing for the different configurations.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, since the needs of people, particularly those who
are older, change over time, there has to be a way to inform
or remind them of services that may help with their latest
needs. Ideally this could be done by someone who has an
understanding of their needs, for example a family member
or carer. In practice, this did not seem to happen.
Professional carers generally do not have the time or
technical competence, and many family members in
practice made the older people feel less technically capable.
Some suggest grandchildren may be better in this regard
[3].</p>
      <p>One can hope that developers will be more successful in the
future, so that people can benefit from what this type of
system promises.</p>
