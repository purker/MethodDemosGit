      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The user interface (UI) is the most important feature of interaction between users and
(AAL) services. It can be critical to the success or failure of an ICT product or service1. In
the course of aging the abilities and special needs of older adults change. Many services
older people could benefit from lack of accessibility, adoptability, and usability of the
user interface and interaction.</p>
      <p>Explicitly defined user interfaces are bound to a specific toolkit and programming or
markup language. Thus a separate UI definition has to be created manually for different
classes of I/O devices to be supported. Compared to manual user interface creation, the
automatic or semi-automatic generation of user interfaces based on interaction
descriptions considerably reduces the manual effort necessary for integrating a large number
of devices and therefore automatically increases the number of supported devices. The
major challenge of using such an approach of automatic or semi-automatic user interface
generation is the quality of the rendered UIs. Especially when developing services and
UIs for older adults who might not be experienced in the use of electronic devices and are
likely limited to certain input and output modalities, it is important to provide products
that ensure maximum accessibility and usability.</p>
      <p>
        The main goal of this paper is to provide an overview of selected existing solutions
for the definition of generic user interactions and the generation of user interfaces –
subsumed as User Interaction Description Languages (UIDL). It is inspired by the
theoretical survey presented in [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ]. The UIDLs are examined and compared to each other,
whereas the focus is on adaptability based on the environmental settings. Other
important criteria, such as level of abstraction, openness, organizational background, status,
number of implementations, and number of supported target platforms, are of importance
as well, but neglected in the presented work. The paper is structured in the following
way: The introduction and objectives are followed by a description of the methodology
in terms of a comparison approach and an overview of UIDLs. Thereafter the results of
the comparison are presented, followed by some final conclusions.

      <title>2. Methodology: Comparison Approach</title>
      <p>We have established a comparison study to analyze UIDLs based on various criteria,
whereas adaptability is of uttermost importance to identify their applicability to
Ambient Assisted Living environments. The criterion adaptability concerns the possibility to
adapt user interfaces automatically based on different environmental settings. For AAL
environments, the following three characteristics concerning adaptability are important:
Accessibility: The UI should automatically adapt to user preferences based on
the user’s abilities and disabilities.</p>
      <p>Use-case awareness: In different use cases, different I/O devices are used. For
example, for activating and deactivating a service, a mobile phone is mostly used
because the user can carry it with him or her, while changing the basic setup of
a service is carried out using a PC due to the more sophisticated input
mechanisms. UIDLs should know about the capabilities of UI devices and automatically
adapt UIs to provide different functionalities on different I/O devices as well as
to present the UI in the way that is supported best by each type of device.
Context-awareness: Finally, it is desirable to automatically adapt the
presentation of a user interface based on environmental influences, for example physical
conditions such as the intensity of light around the I/O device.</p>

      <title>3. Overview User Interface Description Languages</title>
      <p>This section presents 15 existing User Interaction Description Languages. For each of
these, some high-level information are given based on available literature and tools as
well as a short analysis of their adaptability.</p>
      <p>
        The Alternate Abstract Interface Markup Language (AAIML) is part of the first
Universal Remote Console (URC) specification [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ]. It is a markup language used for
defining UI descriptions in an abstract way, based on XML. In practice, an AAIML document
contains an AAIML model that describes the UI of exactly one target service that can be
controlled from a remote console device. As part of the abstract user interaction
description language, classes may be defined that restrict certain interactions to special devices
and therefore to certain use-cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Presentation Template (PreT) Markup Language is part of the ISO/IEC 24752
standard [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ], which is the direct successor of the ANSI/INCITS 389 through 393 standards
family. It defines the latest specification of Universal Remote Console (URC). The
concrete UI is rendered individually for the UI device’s platform at run-time, based on the
capabilities of the available services. Thus it supports in theory an unlimited number of
I/O devices. It lets the user choose the device as remote console, which is an important
step towards accessibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Extensible Interface Markup Language (XIML) is a framework for defining
abstract UIs and transforming them to concrete ones. In addition, it offers several methods
for the automatic adaptation of UIs, based on different criteria. Its main focus is the use
case of a generic UI, defined once for an application, which can be executed on a
variety of devices, using different platforms [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ]. User profiles and preferences can be
specified. Personalization is integrated using automatic exchange of UI widgets. The
mechanism of automatically generating rules for mapping intermediate presentation elements
to concrete UI widgets provides a flexible way to react to contextual settings, device
capabilities, use-cases, user preferences, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Extensible Interaction Scenario Language (XISL) was designed with regard to
changing Internet usage behavior. It is a language for describing online multi-modal
interaction systems, using an XML based syntax. It describes interaction scenarios rather
than concrete UIs, thus being applicable to many different interaction modalities. XISL
is based on existing open standards such as VoiceXML [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ] and SMIL [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ], but advances
their concepts in a modality-independent approach. It does not provide any framework
for automatic adaptation, but extensions can be customized for rendering the UI and
adapting it to users’ needs or environmental settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Web Services Description Language (WSDL) specifies an XML-based language
to describe web services based on their functionality [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ]. It is used to define the
functionality a web service offers and the interactions to access a certain functionality. Although
WSDL is often used in combination with SOAP in practice, the language is
protocolindependent. It does neither define nor generate UI.
      </p>
      <p>The Web Service eXperience Language (WSXL) was developed to reduce
development effort while building web applications for different distribution channels by re-use.
Service-based web applications specified using WSXL can easily be adapted to different
presentation scenarios. This means that one web application can be accessed in different
ways without the need of redevelopment. The adaptability description framework was
designed for adaptation to different distribution channels inside the usage context of web
services. No built-in support for the automatic adaptation is provided, but it could easily
be added by external toolkits.</p>
      <p>
        The USer Interface eXtensible Markup Language (UsiXML) is an XML-based
markup language that can be used to define UIs in an abstract way, modality independent
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ]. Its main goal is to reduce the effort necessary for generating UIs to be used in
multiple contexts of use. It addresses mainly designers, in contrast to traditional UI toolkits
that are often integrated into programming frameworks aiming at developers. So, full
adaptability of UI is supported.
      </p>
      <p>
        User Interface Markup Language (UIML) is a meta-language, not specifying
concrete UI elements on its own, but providing a framework for the definition of custom
vocabularies that can then be used to create generic UI descriptions. The development
of UIML was inspired by the generic concept of HTML, which provided one markup
language that could be rendered on several platforms [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ]. Based on this, UIML’s main
goal is helping UI developers in creating UIs that are sufficiently generic to be used on
different platforms, thus significantly reducing the effort in developing multi-platform
UIs. UIs defined using UIML are either automatically transformed to different target
languages, or interpreted and rendered on target devices in real-time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Dialog and Interface Specification Language (DISL) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ] is an extended subset
of the UIML language specification. It provides a modeling language for specifying
dialog models in an abstract way that can be used to generate UIs for multiple modalities
and platforms. The language is designed to support switching between end devices on
the fly. Adaptability is a built-in core component.
      </p>
      <p>
        Model-based lAnguage foR Interactive Applications XML (MARIA XML) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ]
mainly focuses on the definition of UIs used to access web service functionalities. The
language follows a semi-automatic approach for generation of UIs: Basic final UIs are
generated automatically from abstract UI descriptions, but developers are given the
possibility to refine these concrete interfaces. This concept allows human intervention, but
reduces manual effort. The mechanism of migratory UI implements an automatic
adaptation based on contexts of use.
      </p>
      <p>The eXtensible Application Markup Language (XAML)2 is a declarative markup
language based on XML developed by Microsoft. While XAML was created as general
markup language for the initialization of structured objects, its main use is the
specification of UIs as part of the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and the definition of
UIs for web applications that build upon the Microsoft Silverlight framework. It does not
provide mechanisms to store users’ preferences and to react to environmental factors.</p>
      <p>The XML User interface Language (XUL) is based on XML and not compiled but
interpreted at run-time by a special rendering engine. Its main use is the definition of
UIs for applications developed by the Mozilla community, although also some additional
projects make use of it. Adaptation could be integrated using the flexible CSS styling
system. XUL UI automatically adapt to different hardware capabilities such as screen
resolution, but limited to simple dynamic resizing and positioning of widgets.</p>
      <p>The Macromedia eXtensible Markup Language (MXML) is a declarative markup
language based on XML originally developed by Macromedia, now used by Adobe as
part of the Flash product series. The main use of MXML is the specification of UIs of
Adobe Flex applications. The compiled applications (SWF) can be run as web applets
2http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms747122.aspx [Accessed: 04/2013]
embedded in any web page, or as standalone applications. Through the use of layout
managers, MXML UI automatically adapt to different screen resolutions by re-positioning
UI elements. The display of different UI on different devices however is not supported.</p>
      <p>VoiceXML is an XML-based markup language used to specify user interaction with
speech-based systems. It was designed with a similar goal as HTML: HTML is used to
specify visual web pages, while VoiceXML allows the specification of audible web
content, featuring both one-way presentations and interactions. No support for adaptability
is provided since the language focuses on speech-based interfaces that are presented in
the course of one telephone call using exactly one device.</p>
      <p>
        The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the markup language used for the
specification of web pages. Version 4 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
        ] is the first version that separates semantics
and appearance. The analysis also applies to the eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language
(XHTML) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
        ]. HTML is based on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML),
while XHTML is based on XML. XML actually is a subset of SGML that adds
additional restrictions to the base language [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
        ]. No automatic adaptation support is provided,
whereas CSS supports multiple media types by enabling styling the control elements
differently for different devices or hiding of some elements for certain devices.

      <title>4. Results</title>
      <p>In Table 1 the results of the comparison regarding adaptability of all analyzed UIDLs
are presented. As shown the characteristics are in a wide range and just some UIDLs are
covering these important aspects (XIML, UsiXML). DISL lacks on accessibility support,
but provided context- and use case-awareness. The solutions studied differ strongly
concerning their field of application. To form a complete user interface generation system
for AAL environments, several of these solutions need to be combined since all operate
on a different degree of abstraction.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>The comparison and the results presented in Section 4 show that the aspect of adaptability
is partly covered by the UIDLs. Nevertheless it is important to analyze them with respect
to additional criteria, like accessibility, context- and use-case awareness, to receive a
meaningful overview of advantages and drawbacks of the different approaches. These
characteristics are chosen due to their importance and relevance in the design of user
interfaces and interaction for users with special needs to access (AAL) services. The
project AALuis3 uses for example Maria XML.</p>
