      <abstract>
        <p>As business processes gain more importance in todays business environment, their unimpeded execution is crucial for a company's success. Corporate decision makers are faced with a wide spectrum of potential risks on the one hand and a plenitude of security safeguards on the other hand. This paper gives an overview of a new approach for the elicitation of security requirements of business processes, for the analysis of threats and vulnerabilities and for the interactive selection of an optimal security level according to the given business processes as well as multiple objectives. It provides decision makers with an instrument for interactively de ning Secure Business Processes that are economically and technically e cient.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        of security is inappropriate, because typically there are multiple - often con icting or mutually
a ecting - factors that need to be considered, e.g., installation costs and running expenditures,
manpower as well as an unimpeded execution of the business process itself (cf. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref2">1, 2</xref>
        ] for security
speci c criteria). By selecting the most appropriate set of measures and, thus, setting the right
level of security-investments, decision makers have to take into consideration not only multiple
objectives, but di erent and changing preferences of several stakeholders, the necessity of
considering existing business processes, and a cost-e cient usage of the available resources
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ]. As a result, decision makers and security experts need to revise methods to secure them
against external or internal threats. This paper proposes a new methodology that combines
elements of risk assessment for a structured process to measure security requirements with
the multiobjective decision making to address multiple relevant factors, workshop techniques
to deal with di erent opinions of di erent stakeholders, and that uses business process models
for eliciting security requirements to account for the process-centered view of todays business
activities.

      <title>A Model-driven Risk-based Decision Making Process</title>
      <p>The proposed approach is separated into three phases and incorporates elements of di erent
disciplines and their strengths: (i) a Model-based elicitation process for deriving security
relevant entities, such as assets and related vulnerabilities, and threats they are exposed to,
(ii) a risk assessment process that provides a structured method for measuring information
security risks, (iii) a workshop environment that ensures the consideration of the di erent
opinions and expertise of di erent participating domain experts, such as security experts,
process owners and other stakeholders, and (iv) an interactive decision making process that
takes multiple criteria into consideration and provides solutions that represent the best
tradeo s of opposed factors.
2.1</p>
      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>Phase 1: Modeling and Identi cation</title>
        <p>The Modeling and Identi cation phase is tasked with the modeling of business processes and
identi cation and modeling of the entities needed for the risk assessment: Assets, threats,
vulnerabilities and possible safeguards. The substeps of this phase can be conducted
iteratively, e.g., the Chief Process O cer and the Process Manager devise the process model,
identify the assets and gure out the threats, then the security expert adds vulnerabilities
and further threats, the CPO adds further assets and the security expert adds corresponding
vulnerabilities and so on.</p>
        <p>Business Process Modeling: At rst, a model (diagram) of the business process under
evaluation is de ned. The model is either newly constructed or, if already existing, simply
imported (e.g., from business process management tools such as Aris or Adonis). As the result
of a minor process improvement or a full scale business process reengineering (BPR) e ort, a
revised process model can then be analyzed for required safeguards.</p>
        <p>Asset Modeling: The next step consists of identifying and modeling all relevant assets that
are part of the process represented by the model developed in the previous step. Assets may
be tangible or intangible e.g., servers and con dential data. Therefore it may help to develop
a hierarchy to display the assets, e.g., categorization into tangible and intangible assets, or
external/internal information.</p>
        <p>
          Vulnerability Identi cation: In this step, all the assets identi ed in the previous step are
analyzed for any possible vulnerabilities. The same vulnerability may apply to multiple assets,
e.g., customer data and stock information residing on the same server. Additionally, security
properties (CIA) may be assigned to vulnerabilities, if they are needed for the decision process.
Threat Modeling/Identi cation: After the identi cation of all applicable vulnerabilities,
all possible threats are identi ed. Existing threat listings may be conferred for a complete
and accurate threat list. For modeling, the concepts of Misuse and Abuse Case models (cf.
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3 ref5">3, 5</xref>
          ]) are adapted: Misuse Case models represent all threats that are the result of misuse of
the system by legitimate and authorized persons, e.g., not intended faults, such as mistyped
characters, or accidental deletion of important data. Additionally, negative events, that are
not directly caused by humans, such as re or hardware failure, are modeled here as well.
Abuse Case models represent all threats that are generated through possible attacks of threat
agents, e.g., intended abuse of the system, such as hacker attacks, viruses, worms and others.
Safeguard Identi cation: The nal step of the rst phase is the Safeguard Identi cation
process, where all safeguards at disposal are identi ed. Again, the resulting list may be
checked against available safeguard checklists in order to generate a complete enumeration of
available security measures.

        <title>Phase 2: Workshop-based Risk Assessment</title>
        <p>The aim of this phase is the composition of risks as asset/threat/vulnerability-tuples, the
de nition of cost/bene t-categories and the assigning of values to the risks and safeguards for
each de ned category. A di culty of this step is the often missing quantitative data about
risks and/or safeguards, such as rate of occurrence. Therefore, the main source of information
is the knowledge of the participating members of this assessment process (e.g., IT/Security
Expert, (Chief) Process Owner, members of the upper and lower management).
Composition of Risks: This phase begins with the composition of risks by assigning the
previously identi ed threats to applicable vulnerabilities. As vulnerabilities are related to
assets, risks are nally de ned as asset/threat/vulnerability-tuples. The next task is to de ne,
which safeguards address which particular vulnerabilities, and subsequently which risks.
Another goal of this substep is to check the list of assets, threats, vulnerabilities and safeguards
for completeness. Any additional relevant entity is appended to the list and included in the
risk composition. This substep terminates when the participants agree on the completeness
and correctness of the risk-tuples and assigned safeguards.</p>
        <p>De nition of Cost/Bene t-Categories: This step involves the de nition of the cost- and
bene t-categories the safeguards are rated against. The careful speci cation of these categories
is of vital importance as these categories should re ect the corporate strategy and security
policy of the company. The criteria are company speci c and individually customizable, and
they can range from monetary quantities (e.g., minimizing the reduction of monetary loss,
monetary costs) to intangible values (e.g., user acceptance, implementation hours, loss of
reputation).</p>
        <p>Quanti cation of Risks and Safeguards: After de ning the cost/bene t-categories, the
risks and safeguards are assigned to appropriate quantitative values. As accurate quantitative
data is often lacking or incomplete, this methodology relies on the expertise of di erent
stakeholders and their experience to accurately estimate data. Other possible sources of information
are any available logs, surveys, standards or other either publicly available or company-owned
documents.</p>

      <sec id="sec-2-3">
        <title>Speci cation of Safeguard Dependencies: The nal step of the risk assessment phase</title>
        <p>includes the speci cation of any safeguard dependencies and their prerequisites (cannibalism
and synergy e ects), the de nition of any safeguards that must be included (must-haves) and
the speci cation of any already implemented safeguards that have to be kept.

      <sec id="sec-2-4">
        <title>Phase 3: Multiobjective Decision Support for Safeguard Selection</title>
        <p>The third and nal phase of the proposed methodology comprises the interactive selection
process using the pre-de ned cost/bene t-categories as objectives and the information about
risks and safeguards, gathered in the preceding phases, as input data.</p>
        <p>The rst step lies in determining e cient safeguard portfolios by identifying all Pareto-e cient
combinations of safeguards (i.e., there is no other solution with equally good or better values
in all K objectives and a strictly better value in at least one objective) where the binary
variables xi 2 f0; 1g indicate whether or not a safeguard i is selected (xi = 1 if so, and
xi = 0 otherwise). Of course, all solutions taken into consideration have to be feasible with
respect to two sets of constraints. The rst set relates to limited resources (e.g., development
costs or maintenance costs). The second set ensures that at most a maximum { or at least a
minimum { number of safeguards from given subsets (e.g., from a certain type of safeguards
such as rewalls) is included in the feasible solutions. In the second phase, the approach
supports decision makers in nally determining the solution that best ts his/her notions
out of the possibly several thousand Pareto-e cient alternatives identi ed in the rst step.
The approach is based on interactive modi cations of lower and upper bounds for one or
more objectives. To this end, the decision support system (DSS) starts with displaying K
bars. For each objective the system provides information on what can be achieved by (i)
the e cient safeguard solutions from solution space and (ii) the subset of solutions that have
remained after the decision maker has entered some aspiration levels. After initializing the
bars with minimum and maximum objective values taken from the alternative safeguards in
solution space, they are intended for restricting the set of remaining solutions in a
step-bystep manner (e.g., by raising the minimum bound in one of the objectives) or for expanding
it (e.g., by once again relaxing some bounds) according to the decision makers preferences. In
all cases, the system provides immediate feedback about the consequences of such choices in
terms of intervals for values achievable with the remaining alternatives. Because this setting
has ltered primarily those solutions that come with relatively high consumptions of resource
category A (such as costs) and high bene ts in category A, the options in the other objectives
have been reduced as well and the position and size of the \ ying" bars representing the
updated span for the achievable objective values have changed accordingly (cf. Figure 1). In
further iterations, the decision maker continues playing with minimum and maximum bounds
and by doing so learns about the consequences of his/her decisions and, thus, will get a much
better \feeling" for the problem in terms of what can be achieved in some objectives at what
\price" in terms of opportunity costs in other objectives. Ample information on the speci c
selection problem is provided to him/her and the DSS ensures that the nal solution will be
an optimal one with no other feasible solution available.
This paper proposed a new methodology for the security management of business processes,
including the elicitation of security requirements of business process, the analysis of threats and
vulnerabilities and the interactive selection of a portfolio of pareto-e cient security safeguards.
By using process models as a starting point for a security analysis of business activities,
companies may focus on the core processes that are vital for generating business value. The
explicit graphical modeling of assets, threats and vulnerabilities supports decision makers in
getting an overview of relevant entities. A structured security risk assessment process ensures
the consideration of all possible threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the valuable assets.
The de nition of the risk assessment phase as a workshop allows for multiple persons to
participate in the process. This is especially important due to the lack of required data for
a formal risk assessment and often the experience and knowledge of domain experts are the
only sources of information. The use of a multiobjective decision support method allows to
address the multidisciplinary nature of the safeguard selection problem. The whole process
can be conducted on a regular basis to reevaluate the current situation of business process
security. The tight connection to processes allows the framework to be included in any Business
Process Improvement e orts, resulting in an improvement of both economic and security
related aspects. As this paper focused on the introduction of this novel approach, further
work will concentrate on re ning this approach and on conducting case studies.</p>
