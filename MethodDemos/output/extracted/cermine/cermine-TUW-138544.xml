        <p>If visual information retrieval should make further progress, it will be necessary to identify new ways to derive visual properties from higher levels of understanding than the pixel level (e.g. from low-level features). The paper outlines the implementation of modelling of feature hierarchies in the visual information retrieval framework VizIR (free under GPL). The approach allows for the derivation of high-level features from low-level features by aggregation and localisation as well as semantic enrichment with additional knowledge. The technical implementation is based on the MPEG-7 structures for aggregation and specialisation.</p>

      <title>1. INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>
        Visual information retrieval (VIR) research is driven by the
desire to derive semantically meaningful information
directly from the content of media objects. Recent years have
seen considerable efforts to overcome the enormous gravity
of the pixel and to extract more than just colour histograms,
edge information and other low-level features. The MPEG-7
standard [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ] supports these efforts in two ways: Firstly, it
provides aggregation and localisation structures for
spatiotemporal feature enrichment. Secondly, it standardises
cookbooks for the most prominent low-level features and, by
that, provides a foundation for semantic enrichment of
lowlevel features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below, we will regard aggregated/localised and
semantically enriched as two relevant types of high-level features.
The paper describes the way high-level feature structures
(e.g. based on MPEG-7 descriptors) can be implemented in
the VIR framework VizIR. The VizIR project [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ] aims at
providing VIR researchers with a workbench of feature
extraction, querying and evaluation tools.
      </p>
      <p>The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 gives
background information on relevant MPEG-7 models and
principles of semantic feature design. Section 3 shortly sketches
the VizIR project. Section 4 describes the architecture of
high-level feature modelling in VizIR. Additionally,
Subsection 4.4 covers important implementation aspects.</p>

      <title>MPEG-7 aggregation and localisation structures</title>
      <p>
        The visual part of the MPEG-7 standard (e.g. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ]) provides a
set of content-based descriptors for colour, texture, shape
and motion properties of visual media objects. In addition, it
allows for using static (image) descriptors on video content
and for spatial as well as temporal localisation of descriptors
in media objects.
      </p>
      <p>For temporal aggregation, MPEG-7 provides the Time
Series descriptor. The Time Series descriptor can be used for
regular time series (constant interval between samples; e.g.
Colour Layout descriptions of key-frames) and irregular time
series. In the latter case a media object is sub-sampled at the
minimum frequency and samples at requested points in time
are selected. MPEG-7 describes how Time Series have to be
extracted and how they have to be compared. Distance
measurement is non-trivial for irregular time series.</p>
      <p>The main construct for localisation is the
SpatioTemporal Locator. It describes object trajectories over space
and time. Spatio-Temporal Locators exist as Figure
Trajectories for non-rigid objects and as Parameter Trajectories for
rigid objects. Both descriptors make use of Region Locators
and the Temporal Interpolation descriptor. Region Locator is
a simple contour-based description of an object (bounding
rectangle, ellipse or polygon). Temporal Interpolation is used
to estimate unavailable samples by assuming a particular
interpolation function. Figure Trajectories describe moving
objects by the trajectories of object vertices. Parameter
Trajectories assume motion models for objects and describe
object movements by parameter sets.

      <title>Semantic feature enrichment</title>
      <p>As human beings we derive our visual similarity perception
from generally perceived (e.g. colour distributions) and
specifically perceived (recognized) media properties. Today's
VIR systems are only capable of extracting generally
perceived (low-level) features. Therefore, retrieval results are
often unsatisfactory for us. To overcome this shortcoming,
considerable research effort is undertaken to enrich
lowlevel features with semantic information.</p>
      <p>Generally, three sources of information are available to
enhance features: (1) information on the application domain
(e.g. on media content), (2) information on the user (e.g.
retrieval preferences) and (3) information on the characteristics
of the descriptors used (e.g. statistical properties).
Technically, additional knowledge can be induced by methods from
statistics, artificial intelligence (e.g. neural networks), etc.
For example, domain knowledge about football could be
used to identify ball and players from shape features (e.g.
circularity, edge distribution).</p>

      <title>3. THE VIZIR PROJECT</title>
      <p>The next three subsections describe the VizIR project in
general and, in greater detail, the environment, in which we
are applying descriptor aggregation, localisation and
enrichment techniques to enhance features and improve
content-based retrieval results.

      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>
        The VizIR framework is an open and extendible software
workbench for content-based video and image retrieval. It
implements state of the art technologies such as the visual
MPEG-7 descriptors, the Multimedia Retrieval Markup
Language [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ] for loose coupling of query engines and user
interfaces, etc. and novel paradigms for feature extraction,
querying (e.g. 3D user interfaces for integrated browsing
and retrieval) and evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>VizIR is free software: it is released as source code
under GNU Public License. The VizIR project intends to
provide a common software platform that can be used by
researchers as a workbench for further VIR research, by
software engineers for the development of VIR components for
media and database applications and by lecturers for teaching
VIR concepts. The VizIR framework was carefully designed
to guarantee that these requirements can be met.</p>
      <p>
        Technically, the VizIR framework components are based
on the Java programming language, the Java SDK, the Java
Media Framework for media processing and other freely
available software libraries. The current status of the project,
software releases, documentation and development resources
can be found on the project website [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ]. VizIR is an open
project: new users and contributors are always welcome.

      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>General framework design</title>
      <p>
        The most important part of VizIR is a class framework for
feature extraction, querying, refinement, VIR user
interfaces, communication, evaluation and benchmarking.
Central element is a service kernel. This class is responsible for
media administration and query execution. It communicates
with query engines, user interfaces and media databases
through XML messages (based on the Multimedia Retrieval
Markup Language, MRML [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ]) and web services.
      </p>
      <p>Media access is hidden in a class that enables accessing
the view of visual media (at arbitrary resolution and based on
an arbitrary colour model) at any point in time. By that,
images and videos can be accessed with a uniform API.
Descriptors and media renderer classes make use of the media
access class to derive features and to visualise media objects
in user interfaces. All elements of user interfaces (including
query definition and refinement panels, metadata panels,
sketch drawing panels, etc.) are modelled as independent
classes that interact with each other through well-defined
events and listener methods (locally) or through XML-based
web services (remotely). They can be combined arbitrarily to
create VIR user interfaces and easily be supplemented by
additional querying methods.</p>
      <p>
        VizIR query engines are derived from a common model.
This model defines how queries are executed technically (not
how the querying logic works). This includes the interface to
MRML communication classes, the service kernel and
paradigms for database access. All VizIR components are based
on an object-oriented database model: If desired, the
resources of instances of any class in the framework can be
serialised and kept persistent in a database. This feature is
guaranteed by an underlying persistence system. The
objectoriented database system may be chosen arbitrarily. In our
test environment we are currently using a relational database
(MySQL) and an object mapping tool (Hibernate). See [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ]
and [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ] for more information on the VizIR architecture.

    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-8">
      <title>Visual feature modelling</title>
      <p>Implementation of visual descriptors is a key requirement in
the VizIR framework. Descriptor data should be calculated
directly from media content and it has to be guaranteed that
the descriptor designer does not have to care for storing the
descriptor data in the database. VizIR provides two types of
classes for the implementation of visual descriptors:
DescriptorInfo classes</p>
      <p>DescriptorLogic classes
Derivates of DescriptorInfo classes hold the (XML)
descriptions extracted by features. These classes have a unique
name and their objects have unique IDs. Objects can be
stored to and read from a database. DescriptorInfo classes
are also factories that can be used to create their associated
DescriptorLogic objects.</p>
      <p>DescriptorLogic classes contain just two methods:
extractFeature() to extract feature data from given media
content and calculateDistance() to measure distance to a second
instance of the same descriptor (a DescriptorInfo object).
Since DescriptorLogic classes contain no relevant status
information, they do not need to be made persistent and may
have arbitrary names.</p>
      <p>The VizIR framework can easily be extended with new
descriptors by creating a new DescriptorInfo class, creating a
new mapping (if the default mapping is not sufficient) and
implementing a private DescriptorLogic class with the
feature extraction logic. New descriptors can be used as soon as
the database mapping (an XML document) is available.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-9">
      <title>4. FEATURE DERIVATION MODELLING</title>
      <p>Below, it will be discussed how the described descriptor
models can be adapted to allow for feature aggregation,
localisation and semantic enrichment. Additionally, in
Subsection 4.4 relevant implementation details will be sketched.
4.1</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-10">
      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>Generally, descriptors could simply be added to the
framework as new classes that make use of already existing
algorithms. To enable this scenario, the algorithms used in
DescriptorLogic classes (e.g. time to frequency
transformations, edge operators) would have to be implemented with a
well-designed configurable API and collected in software
libraries. Still, for the sake of transparency, good software
design and maximum code reuse, it would be desirable to
have more sophisticated descriptor extension mechanisms
available.</p>
      <p>DescriptorInfo
create</p>
      <p>Figure 1 describes the general architecture of descriptor
design and derivation in the VizIR framework. The left side
of the figure shows the data classes. The right side shows the
algorithms. The top half shows a low-level descriptor. The
bottom half shows a derived descriptor. The design depicted
in the figure will be discussed in the next two subsections.
Essentially, the idea is that semantically enriched descriptors
should be derived from data classes, since they may use
completely different algorithms. Aggregated and localised
descriptors should be derived from the algorithm classes,
because they produce different data classes by using the same
or similar algorithms.
4.2</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-11">
      <title>Feature aggregation and localisation</title>
      <p>In VizIR, descriptors are stored to databases through an
object-oriented mapping technique. Instances of descriptors
containing media-specific data are serialised to BLOBs. The
BLOBs are referenced by unique IDs (including the class
name). For this approach it is necessary that descriptors that
create specific output have unique names.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, for example, in the MPEG-7 standard,
visual descriptors can be configured to create different
descriptions (e.g. Scalable Colour histograms may have 32 or
64 bins). If the descriptor classes creating these descriptions
would be of the same name and be configured for specific
use (e.g. by getters/setters), incompatible descriptions could
not be distinguished in VizIR. Therefore, as a first step for
aggregation/localisation it is necessary to find an appropriate
solution for descriptor configuration.</p>
      <p>The solution in VizIR, shown in the top right of Figure
1, is straight-forward: The fundamental description procedure
is implemented in a DescriptorLogic class. This class may be
defined as being abstract. Optionally, the algorithmic details
may be laid down in a separate DescriptorModel class (e.g.
transformations, visual operators). For parameterisation, the
DescriptorLogic class has a constructor with all relevant
parameters. To use a specific version of the descriptor it is
subclassed with a default descriptor that calls the super
descriptor with the desired parameters (e.g. histogram size). Since
the sub-class needs to have a unique name, its instances can
easily be stored to a database and be distinguished from other
versions of the same descriptor.</p>
      <p>The same pattern is used for aggregation and
localisation. This feature is implemented as a parameter of type
Spatio-Temporal Locator (MPEG-7; in VizIR: a Java class).
Then, basically, a spatially and/or temporally specific version
of a descriptor is a sub-class of the general descriptor
algorithm. In case of aggregation, if an additional envelope is
required (e.g. a Time Series container or a Figure Trajectory,
see Subsection 2.1) it is necessary to overload the
corresponding DescriptorInfo class of DescriptorLogic as well.
Again, since the class name of the derived class is unique,
this means no problem for the persistence system.</p>
      <p>Figure 2 shows a further case of simple localisation and
aggregation. If the specialised feature is the result of
subsampling of existing descriptor data, the
aggregation/localisation process can be performed by an XSL
transformer encapsulated in a DescriptorLogic class.
4.3</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-12">
      <title>Semantic feature enrichment</title>
      <p>In contrast to aggregation and localisation, completely
different workflows and algorithms are used for semantic
enrichment of features. In consequence, it would not make
sense to derive semantic descriptors on the algorithm level
(DescriptorLogic). In VizIR, semantic feature classes are
descriptions (DescriptorInfo objects) derived from existing
descriptions. Figure 3 sketches this process. Descriptor data
and additional knowledge are used to create semantic
features. If the enrichment process is linear and all required

information is available as XML structured data, again, an
XSL transformer is sufficient to create the semantic feature.</p>
      <p>If a more sophisticated logic (e.g. a statistical procedure)
is applied for semantic enrichment, it is recommended to
embed the enrichment process in a DescriptorLogic class that
is not derived from the feature extraction classes used for the
low-level features. This paradigm guarantees the existence of
reasonable data and logic classes for any type of feature.
Consequently, arbitrarily long chains of semantic enrichment,
aggregation and localisation of features can be modelled and
implemented in VizIR.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-13">
      <title>4.4 Implementation details</title>
      <p>VizIR is based on the Java programming language. Although
persistence management is based on an object-oriented
database model, it is an important design goal that descriptors
are stored into the database in a valid XML format (e.g. the
MPEG-7 schemes). Non-VizIR applications (e.g. XSL
transformers) have to be able to read the descriptions as well.
Internally, descriptions are represented by appropriate
memory structures (essentially, one class per tag). Handling is
based on the Document Object Model (DOM) of the World
Wide Web Consortium. The JDom package is used for
description parsing and writing. To guarantee that the database
requirement is met, JDom is used to (redundantly) serialise
the description DOMs to string variables. These strings are
stored in the database and used as starting point for semantic
enrichment of features.</p>
      <p>
        As pointed out above, XSL transformers could solve
some of the problems associated with feature aggregation,
localisation and enrichment. At the moment, several
frameworks for XSL transformation are available and under
development. We are currently preferring the Cocoon framework
of the Apache project [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ], as it is Java-based, in a mature
state and easy to install and use. For the applications
proposed above, implementing an appropriate transformation
style-sheet would be sufficient.

      <title>5. CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>In this paper, we sketch solutions for the manipulation of
visual features in the visual information retrieval framework
Descriptor data
Descriptor data
VizIR. Considered manipulations are aggregation of feature
data over time, localisation in time and/or space and
semantic enrichment of features with additional knowledge.
Solutions are software patterns for the derivation of feature logic
classes and data classes as well as interfaces to helpful
external components (e.g. XSL transformers). The presented
solutions will be implemented in the VizIR framework and
be made available to the VIR community as free software.</p>
