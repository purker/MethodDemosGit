        <p>We introduce a new approach for establishing xed-parameter tractability of problems parameterized above tight lower bounds or below tight upper bounds. To illustrate the approach we consider two problems of this type of unknown complexity that were introduced by Mahajan, Raman and Sikdar (J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 75, 2009). We show that a generalization of one of the problems and three nontrivial special cases of the other problem admit kernels of quadratic size.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A parameterized problem can be considered as a set of pairs (I; k) where I
is the main part and k (usually an integer) is the parameter. is called
xedparameter tractable (FPT) if membership of (I; k) in can be decided in time
O(f (k)jIjc), where jIj denotes the size of I, f (k) is a computable function, and
c is a constant independent of k and I (for further background and terminology
on parameterized complexity we refer the reader to the monographs [7, 8, 16]).
If the nonparameterized version of (where k is just a part of the input) is
NP-hard, then the function f (k) must be superpolynomial provided P 6= NP.
Often f (k) is \moderately exponential," which makes the problem practically
feasible for small values of k. Thus, it is important to parameterize a problem
in such a way that the instances with small values of k are of real interest.</p>
      <p>Consider the following well-known problem: given a digraph D = (V; A),
nd an acyclic subdigraph of D with the maximum number of arcs. We can
parameterize this problem \naturally" by asking whether D contains an acyclic
subdigraph with at least k arcs. It is easy to prove that this parameterized
problem is xed-parameter tractable by observing that D always has an acyclic
subdigraph with at least jAj=2 arcs. (Indeed, consider a bijection : V !
f1; : : : ; jV jg and the following subdigraphs of D: (V; f xy 2 A : (x) &lt; (y) g)
and (V; f xy 2 A : (x) &gt; (y) g). Both subdigraphs are acyclic and at least one
of them has at least jAj=2 arcs.) However, k jAj=2 for every small value of k
and almost every practical value of jAj and, thus, our \natural" parameterization
is of almost no practical or theoretical interest.</p>
      <p>Instead, one should consider the following parameterized problem: decide
whether D = (V; A) contains an acyclic subdigraph with at least jAj=2 + k
arcs. We choose jAj=2 + k because jAj=2 is a tight lower bound on the size of
a largest acyclic subdigraph. Indeed, the size of a largest acyclic subdigraph of
a symmetric digraph D = (V; A) is precisely jAj=2. (A digraph D = (V; A) is
symmetric if xy 2 A implies yx 2 A.)</p>
      <p>In a recent paper [15] Mahajan, Raman and Sikdar provided several
examples of problems of this type and argued that a natural parameterization is one
above a tight lower bound for maximization problems, and below a tight upper
bound for minimization problems. Furthermore, they observed that only a few
non-trivial results are known for problems parameterized above a tight lower
bound [10, 11, 13, 14], and they listed several problems parameterized above a
tight lower bound whose complexity is unknown. The di culty in showing
whether such a problem is xed-parameter tractable can be illustrated by the
fact that often we even do not know whether the problem is in XP, i.e., can
be solved in time O(jIjg(k)) for a computable function g(k). For example, it
is non-trivial to see that the above-mentioned digraph problem is in XP when
parameterized above the jAj=2 bound.</p>
      <p>In this paper we introduce the Strictly Above/Below Expectation Method
(SABEM), a novel approach for establishing the xed-parameter tractability
of maximization problems parameterized above tight lower bounds and
minimization problems parameterized below tight upper bounds. The new method
is based on probabilistic arguments and utilizes certain probabilistic inequalities.
We will state the equalities in the next section, and in the subsequent sections
we will apply SABEM to two open problems posed in [15].</p>
      <p>Now we give a very brief description of the new method with respect to
a given problem parameterized above a tight lower bound or below a tight
upper bound. We rst apply some reductions rules to reduce to its special
case 0: Then we introduce a random variable X such that the answer to is
yes if and only if X takes, with positive probability, a value greater or equal
to the parameter k. Now using some probabilistic inequalities on X, we derive
upper bounds on the size of no-instances of 0 in terms of a function of the
parameter k. If the size of a given instance exceeds this bound, then we know
the answer is yes; otherwise, we produce a problem kernel [7]. In many cases,
we obtain problem kernels of polynomial size.</p>
      <p>In Section 3, we consider the Linear Ordering problem, a generalization
of the problem discussed above: Given a digraph D = (V; A) in which each
arc ij has a positive integral weight wij , nd an acyclic subdigraph of D of
maximum weight. Observe that W=2, where W is the sum of all arc weights,
is a tight lower bound for Linear Ordering. We prove that the problem
parameterized above W=2 is xed-parameter tractable and admits a quadratic
kernel. Note that this parameterized problem generalizes the parameterized
maximum acyclic subdigraph problem considered in [15]; thus, our result answers
the corresponding open question of [15].</p>
      <p>
        In Section 4, we consider the problem Max Lin-2: Given a system of m
linear equations e1; : : : ; em in n variables over GF(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ), and for each equation ej
a positive integral weight wj ; nd an assignment of values to the n variables
that maximizes the total weight of the satis ed equations. We will see that
W=2, where W = w1 + + wm, is a tight lower bound for Max Lin-2. The
complexity of the problem parameterized above W=2 is open [15]. We prove
that the following three special cases of the parameterized problem are
xedparameter tractable: (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ) there is a set U of variables such that each equation
has an odd number of variables from U , (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ) there is a constant r such that each
equation involves at most r variables, (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ) there is a constant such that any
variable appears in at most equations. For all three cases we obtain kernels
with O(k2) variables and equations. We also show that if we allow the weights wj
to be positive reals, the problem is NP-hard already if k = 1 and each equation
involves two variables.
      </p>
      <p>In Section 5, we brie y mention minimization problems parameterized below
tight upper bounds, provide further discussions of problems considered in this
paper and point out to a very recent result obtained using our new method.

      <title>Probabilistic Inequalities</title>
      <p>In our approach we introduce a random variable X such that the answer to the
problem parameterized above a tight lower bound or below a tight upper bound
is yes if and only if X takes with positive probability a value greater or equal
to the parameter k.</p>
      <p>In this paper all random variables are real. A random variable is discrete if
its distribution function has a nite or countable number of positive increases.
A random variable X is a symmetric if X has the same distribution function
as X. If X is discrete, then X is symmetric if and only if Prob(X = a) =
Prob(X = a) for each real a: Let X be a symmetric variable for which the rst
moment E(X) exists. Then E(X) = E( X) = E(X) and, thus, E(X) = 0:
The following is easy to prove [17].</p>

      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>Prob( X</title>
        <p>pE(X2) ) &gt; 0:
See Sections 3 and 4 for applications of Lemma 1. Unfortunately, often X is not
symmetric, but Lemma 2 provides an inequality that can be used in many such
cases. This lemma was proved by Alon et al. [2]; a weaker version was obtained
by Hastad and Venkatesh [12].</p>
        <p>Lemma 2. Let X be a random variable and suppose that its rst, second and
forth moments satisfy E(X) = 0, E(X2) = 2 &gt; 0 and E(X4) b 4,
respectively. Then Prob( X &gt; 4pb ) 441=3b .
Since it is often rather nontrivial to evaluate E(X4) in order to check whether
E(X4) b 4 holds, one can sometimes use the following result by Bourgain [5].
Lemma 3. Let f = f (x1; : : : ; xn) be a polynomial of degree r in n variables
x1; : : : ; xn with domain f 1; 1g. De ne a random variable X by choosing a
vector ( 1; : : : ; n) 2 f 1; 1gn uniformly at random and setting X = f ( 1; : : : ; n).

      <title>Linear Ordering</title>
      <p>Let D = (V; A) be a digraph with no loops or parallel arcs in which every arc
ij has a positive weight wij . The problem of nding an acyclic subdigraph
of D of maximum weight, known as Linear Ordering, has applications in
economics [3]. Let n = jV j and consider a bijection : V ! f1; : : : ; ng. Observe
that the subdigraphs (V; f ij 2 A : (i) &lt; (j) g) and (V; f ij 2 A : (i) &gt;
(j) g) are acyclic. Since the two subdigraphs contain all arcs of D, at least one
of them has weight at least W=2, where W = Pij2A wij , the weight of D. Thus,
W=2 is a lower bound on the maximum weight of an acyclic subdigraph of D.
Consider a digraph D where for every arc ij of D there is also an arc ji of the
same weight. Each maximum weight subdigraph of D has weight exactly W=2.
Hence the lower bound W=2 is tight.</p>
      <p>Linear Ordering Above Tight Lower Bound (LOALB)
Instance: A digraph D = (V; A), each arc ij has an integral positive
weight wij , and a positive integer k.</p>
      <p>Parameter: The integer k.</p>
      <p>Question: Is there an acyclic subdigraph of D of weight at least W=2+k,
where W = Pij2A wij ?
Mahajan, Raman, and Sikdar [15] asked whether LOALB is xed-parameter
tractable for the special case when all arcs are of weight 1 (i.e., D is unweighted).
In this section we will prove that LOALB admits a kernel with O(k2) arcs;
consequently the problem is xed-parameter tractable. Note that if we allow
weights to be positive reals, then we can show, similarly to the NP-completeness
proof given in the next section, that LOALB is NP-complete already for k = 1.</p>
      <p>Consider the following reduction rule:
Reduction Rule 1 Assume D has a directed 2-cycle iji; if wij = wji delete
the cycle, if wij &gt; wji delete the arc ji and replace wij by wij wji, and if
wji &gt; wij delete the arc ij and replace wji by wji wij .</p>
      <p>It is easy to check that the answer to LOALB for a digraph D is yes if and
only if the answer to LOALB is yes for a digraph obtained from D using the
reduction rule as long as possible.</p>
      <p>Let D = (V; A) be an oriented graph, let n = jV j and W = Pij2A wij .
Consider a random bijection: : V ! f1; : : : ; ng and a random variable X( ) =
21 Pij2A ij ( ), where ij ( ) = wij if (i) &lt; (j) and ij ( ) = wij , otherwise.
It is easy to see that X( ) = Pf wij : ij 2 A; (i) &lt; (j) g
answer to LOALB is yes if and only if there is a bijection
such that X( ) k. Since E( ij) = 0, we have E(X) = 0.</p>
      <p>
        Let W (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ) = Pij2A wi2j. We will prove the following:
Lemma 4. E(X2)
where the second sum is taken over ordered pairs of distinct arcs. Clearly,
Pij2A E( i2j) = W (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ): To compute Pij;pq2A E( ij pq) we consider the following
cases:
Case 1: fi; jg \ fp; qg = ;. Then ij and pq are independent and E( ij pq) =
E( ij)E( pq) = 0.
      </p>
      <p>Case 2a: jfi; jg \ fp; qgj = 1 and i = p. Since the probability that i &lt;
minfj; qg or i &gt; maxfj; qg is 2=3, ij iq = wijwiq with probability 32 and ij iq =
wijwiq with probability 31 . Thus, for every i 2 V we have Pij;iq2A E( ij iq) =
13 Pf wijwiq : j 6= q 2 N +(i) g = 13 (Pj2N+(i) wij)2 13 Pj2N+(i) wi2j.
Case 2b: jfi; jg \ fp; qgj = 1 and j = q. Similarly to Case 2a, we obtain
Pij;pj2A E( ij pj) = 13 (Pi2N (j) wij)2 13 Pi2N (j) wi2j.</p>
      <p>Case 3a: jfi; jg \ fp; qgj = 1 and i = q. Since ij pi = wijwpi with
probability 13 and ij pi = wijwpi with probability 23 , we obtain Pij;pi2A E( ij pi) =
13 Pf wijwpi : j 2 N +(i); p 2 N (i) g = 31 Pj2N+(i) wij Pp2N (i) wpi.
Case 3b: jfi; jg \ fp; qgj = 1 and j = p. Similarly to Case 3a, we obtain

Theorem 1. The problem LOALB admits a kernel with O(k2) arcs.
Proof. Let H be a digraph. We know that the answer to LOALB for H is yes
if and only if the answer to LOALB is yes for a digraph D obtained from H
using Reduction Rule 1 as long as possible. Observe that D is an oriented graph.
Let B be the set of bijections from V to f1; : : : ; ng. Observe that f : B ! B
such that f ( (v)) = jV j + 1 (v) for each 2 B is a bijection. Note that
X(f ( )) = X( ) for each 2 B. Therefore, Prob(X = a) = Prob(X = a)
for each real a and, thus, X is symmetric. Thus, by Lemmas 1 and 4, we have
Prob( X pW (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
          )=12 ) &gt; 0. Hence, if pW (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
          )=12 k, there is a bijection
: V ! f1; : : : ; ng such that X( ) k and, thus, the answer to LOALB (for
both D and H) is yes. Otherwise, jAj W (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
          ) &lt; 12 k2. tu
We close this section by outlining how Theorem 1 can be used to actually nd
a solution to LOALB if one exists. Let (D; k) be an instance of LOALB where
D = (V; A) is a directed graph with integral positive arc-weights and k 1 is an
integer. Let W be the total weight of D. As discussed above, we may assume
that D is an oriented graph. If jAj &lt; 12k2 then we can nd a solution, if one
exists, by trying all subsets A0 A, and testing whether (V; A0) is acyclic and
has weight at least W=2 + k; this search can be carried out in time 2O(k2). Next
we assume jAj 12k2. We know by Theorem 1 that (D; k) is a yes-instance; it
remains to nd a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a vertex i 2 V let dD(i) denote its unweighted degree in D, i.e., the
number of arcs (incoming or outgoing) that are incident with i. Consider the
following reduction rule:
Reduction Rule 2 If there is a vertex i 2 V with jAj
delete i from D.
12k2
dD(i), then
Observe that by applying the rule we obtain again a yes-instance (D i; k)
of LOALB since D i has still at least 12k2 arcs. Moreover, if we know a
solution Di0 of (D i; k), then we can e ciently obtain a solution D0 of (D; k):
if Pj2N+(i) wij Pj2N (i) wij then we add i and all outgoing arcs ij 2 A
to D0; otherwise, we add i and all incoming arcs ji 2 A to D0. After multiple
i i
applications of Rule 2 we are left with an instance (D0; k) to which Rule 2 cannot
be applied. Let D0 = (V0; A0). We pick a vertex i 2 V0. If i has a neighbor j
with dD0 (j) = 1, then jA0j 12k2, since jA0j dD0 (j) &lt; 12k2. On the other
hand, if dD0 (j) 2 for all neighbors j of i, then i has less than 2 12k2 neighbors,
i has less than 12k2 arcs; thus jA0j &lt; 3 12k2. Therefore, as above,
tsiimncee 2DO0(k2) is su cient to try all subsets A00 A0 to nd a solution to the
instance (D0; k). Let n denote the input size of instance (D; k). Rule 2 can
certainly be applied in polynomial time nO(
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
          ), and we apply it less than n times.
Hence, we can nd a solution to (D; k), if one exists, in time nO(
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
          ) + 2O(k2).
        </p>
        <p>Recall that a kernelization reduces in polynomial time an instance (I; k) of
a parameterized problem to a decision-equivalent instance (I0; k0), its problem
kernel, where k0 k and the size of I0 is bounded by a function of k. Solutions
for (I; k) and solutions for (I0; k0) are possibly unrelated to each other. We call
(I0; k0) a faithful problem kernel if from a solution for (I0; k0) we can construct a
solution for (I; k) in time polynomial in jIj and k. Clearly the above (D0; k) is
a faithful kernel.

When we wish to assign 0 or 1 to zi, we consider all equations reduced to the
form zi = b, for a constant b. Let W 0 be the total weight of all such equations.
We set zi := 0, if the total weight of such equations is at least W 0=2, and set
zi := 1, otherwise. If there are no equations of the form zi = b, we set zi := 0:

where W = Pm</p>
        <p>
          i=1 wi?
Let rj be the number of variables in equation ej , and let r(S) = maxim=1 rj .
We are not able to determine whether LinALB is xed-parameter tractable or
not, but we can prove that the following three special cases are xed-parameter
tractable: (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
          ) there is a set U of variables such that each equation contains an
odd number of variables from U , (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
          ) there is a constant r such that r(S) r,
(
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
          ) there is a constant such that any variable appears in at most equations.
        </p>
        <p>Notice that in our formulation of LinALB it is required that each equation
has a positive integral weight. In a relaxed setting in which an equation may
have any positive real number as its weight, the problem is NP-complete even
for k = 1 and each rj = 2. Indeed, let each linear equation be of the form
zu + zv = 1. Then the problem is equivalent to MaxCut, the problem of
nding a cut of total weight at least L in an undirected graph G, where V (G)
is the set of variables, E(G) contains (zu; zv) if and only if there is a linear
equation zu + zv = 1, and the weight of an edge (zu; zv) equals the weight of
the corresponding linear equation. The problem MaxCut is a well-known
NPcomplete problem. Let us transform an instance I of MaxCut into an instance
I0 of the \relaxed" LinALB by replacing the weight wi by wi0 := wi=(L W=2).
We may assume that L W=2 &gt; 0 since otherwise the instance is immediately
seen as a yes-instance. Observe that the new instance I0 has an assignment of
values with total weight at least W 0=2 + 1 if and only if I has a cut with total
weight at least L. We are done.</p>
        <p>Let A be the matrix of the coe cients of the variables in S. It is well-known
that the maximum number of linearly independent columns of A equals rankA,
and such a collection of columns can be found in time polynomial in n and m,
using, e.g., the Gaussian elimination on columns [4]. We have the following
reduction rule and supporting lemma.</p>
        <p>Reduction Rule 3 Let A be the matrix of the coe cients of the variables in
S, let t = rankA and let columns ai1 ; : : : ; ait of A be linearly independent. Then
delete all variables not in fzi1 ; : : : ; zit g from the equations of S.
Lemma 5. Let T be obtained from S by Rule 3. Then T is a yes-instance if
and only if S is a yes-instance. Moreover, T can be obtained from S in time
polynomial in n and m.</p>
        <p>Proof. If t = n, set T := S, so assume that t &lt; n: The remark before the lemma
immediately implies that T can be obtained from S in time polynomial in n and
m. Let S0 be a system of equations from S and let T 0 be the corresponding
system of equations from T . It is su cient to prove the following claim:</p>
        <p>There is an assignment of values to z1; : : : ; zn satisfying all equations in S0
and falsifying the rest of equations in S if and only if there is an assignment
of values to zi1 ; : : : ; zit satisfying all equations in T 0 and falsifying the rest of
equations in T .</p>
        <p>Let an assignment z0 of values to z = (z1; : : : ; zn) satisfy all equations of S0
and falsify the equations of S00, where S00 = S n S0: This assignment satis es
all equations of R, the system obtained from S by replacing the right hand side
bj of each equation in S00 by 1 bj : Note that R has the same matrix A of
coe cients with columns a1; : : : ; an: Let a column ai 62 fai1 ; : : : ; ait g: Then, by
de nition of ai1 ; : : : ; ait , ai = 1ai1 + + tait for some numbers j 2 f0; 1g:
Knowing the numbers j , we may eliminate a variable zi from R by replacing ai
with the sum of all columns from fai1 ; : : : ; ait g for which j = 1 and carrying
out the obvious simpli cation of the system. Thus, we may eliminate from R
all variables zi 62 fzi1 ; : : : ; zit g and get yi1 ai1 + + yit ait = b0; where b0 is the
right hand side of R and each yj 2 f0; 1g: Now replace, in the modi ed R, the
right hand side b0j of each equation corresponding to an equation in S00 by 1 b0j
obtaining T . Clearly, (yi1 ; : : : ; yit ) satis es all equations of T 0 and falsi es all
equations in T 00 = T n T 0:</p>
        <p>Suppose now that (yi1 ; : : : ; yit ) satis es all equations of T 0 and falsi es all
equations in T 00. Then (y1; : : : ; yn), where yj = 0 if j 62 fi1; : : : ; itg, satis es
all equations of S0 and falsi es all equations in S00. Thus, the claim has been
proved. tu</p>
        <p>Consider the following reduction rule for LinALB used in [12].</p>
        <p>Reduction Rule 4 If we have, for a subset I of f1; 2; : : : ; ng, the equation
Pi2I zi = b0 with weight w0, and the equation Pi2I zi = b00 with weight w00, then
we replace this pair by one of these equations with weight w0 + w00 if b0 = b00 and,
otherwise, by the equation whose weight is bigger, modifying its new weight to
be the di erence of the two old ones. If the resulting weight is 0, we omit the
equation from the system.</p>
        <p>If Rule 4 is not applicable to a system we call the system reduced under Rule
4. Note that the problem LinALB for S and the system obtained from S by
applying Rule 4 as long as possible have the same answer.</p>
        <p>
          Let Ij f1; : : : ; ng be the set of indices of the variables participating in
equation ej , and let bj 2 f0; 1g be the right hand side of ej . De ne a random
variable X = Pjm=1 Xj , where Xj = (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
          )bj wj Qi2Ij i and all the i are
independent uniform random variables on f 1; 1g (X was rst introduced in [12]).
We set zi = 0 if i = 1 and zi = 1, otherwise, for each i. Observe that Xj = wj
if ej is satis ed and Xj = wj , otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>Lemma 6. Let S be reduced under Rule 4. The weight of the satis ed equations
is at least W=2 + k if and only if X 2k. We have E(X) = 0 and E(X2) =
Pm</p>
        <p>j=1 wj2:
Proof. Observe that X is the di erence between the weights of satis ed and
falsi ed equations. Therefore, the weight of the satis ed equations equals (X +
W )=2, and it is at least W=2 + k if and only if X 2k. Since i are independent,
E(Qi2Ij i) = Qi2Ij E( i) = 0. Thus, E(Xj ) = 0 and E(X) = 0 by linearity of
expectation. Moreover,</p>

is the symmetric di erence between Ij and Iq (Ij Iq 6= ; due to Rule 4). tu
Lemma 7. Let S be reduced under Rule 4 and suppose that no variable appears
in more than 2 equations of S. Then E(X4) 2 2(E(X2))2:</p>

and ws2wt2 appear in our upper bound on E(XpXqXsXt) (with coe cient 1/2).
Therefore, there are only four possible ways for wj2wl2 to appear in our upper
bound, namely the following: (i) j = p; l = q, (ii) l = p; j = q, (iii) j = s; l = t,
and (iv) l = s; j = t: Now assume, without loss of generality, that j = p and
l = q. Since S is reduced under Rule 4, the product Xj Xl must have a variable
i of degree one. Thus, i must be in Xs or Xt, but not in both (two choices).
Assume that i is in Xs. Observe that there are at most 1 choices for s. Note
that Xj XlXs must contain contain a variable i0 of odd degree. Thus, i0 must
be in Xt and, hence, there are at most 1 choices for t.

Thus, by Lemma 6, E(X4) 2 2(E(X2))2: tu</p>
          <p>Case 1 of Theorem 2 is of interest since its condition can be checked in
polynomial time due to the following:
Proposition 1. We can check, in polynomial time, whether there exists a set
U of variables such that each equation of S contains an odd number of variables
from U .</p>
          <p>
            Proof. Observe that such a set U exists if and only if the unweighted system S0
of linear equations over GF(
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
            ) obtained from S by replacing each bj with 1 has
a solution. Indeed, if U exists, set zj = 1 for each zj 2 U and zj = 0 for each
zj 62 U . This assignment is a solution to S0: If a solution to S0 exists, form U
by including in it all variables zj which equal 1 in the solution. We can check
whether S0 has a solution using the Gaussian elimination or other
polynomialtime algorithms, see, e.g., [6]. tu
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we can prove the following:
Theorem 2. Let S be reduced under Rule 4. The following three special cases
of LinALB are xed-parameter tractable: (
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
            ) there is a set U of variables such
that each equation contains an odd number of variables from U , (
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
            ) there is a
constant r such that r(S) r, (
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
            ) there is a constant , such that any variable
appears in at most equations. In each case, there exists a kernel with O(k2)
equations and variables.
          </p>
          <p>Proof. Case 1. Let z0 = (z10; : : : ; zn0) 2 f0; 1gn be an assignment of values
to the variables z1; : : : ; zn; and let z0 = (z10; : : : ; zn0); where zi0 = 1 zi0 if
zi 2 U and zi0 = zi0; otherwise, i = 1; : : : ; n: Observe that f : z0 7! z0
is a bijection on the set of assignments and X( z0) = X(z0). Thus, X is a
symmetric random variable. Therefore, by Lemmas 1 and 6, Prob( X pm )
Prob( X qPjm=1 wj2 ) &gt; 0: Hence, if pm 2k, the answer to LinALB is
yes. Otherwise, m &lt; 4k2 and after applying Rule 3, we obtain a kernel with
O(k2) equations and variables.</p>
          <p>Case 2. Since X is a polynomial of degree at most r, it follows by Lemma
3 that E(X4) 26rE(X2)2. This inequality and the results in the
previous paragraph show that the conditions of Lemma 2 are satis ed and, thus,
Prob X &gt; pP4jm8=r1 wj2 &gt; 0; implying Prob X &gt; 4p8mr &gt; 0: Consequently,
if 2k 1 pm=(4 8r), then there is an assignment of values to the variables
z1; : : : ; zn which satis es equations of total weight at least W=2 + k. Otherwise,
2k 1 &gt; pm=(4 8r) and m &lt; 16(2k 1)264r. After applying Rule 3, we obtain
the required kernel.</p>
          <p>Case 3. If = 1, it is easy to nd an assignment to the variables that satis es
all equations of S. Thus, we may assume that 2: To prove that there exists
a kernel with O(k2) equations, we can proceed as in Case 2, but use Lemma 7
rather than Lemma 3. tu
Remark 1. Note that even if S does not satisfy Case 2 of the theorem, T , the
system obtained from S using Rule 3, may still satisfy Case 2. However, we have
not formulated the theorem for S reduced under Rule 3 as the reduced system
depends on the choice of a maximum linear independent collection of columns
of A.

      <title>Discussions</title>
      <p>We have showed that the new method allows us to prove that some maximization
problems parameterized above tight lower bounds are xed-parameter tractable.
Our method can also be used for minimization problems parameterized below
tight upper bounds. As a simple example, consider the feedback arc problem:
given a digraph D = (V; A) nd a minimum set F of arcs such that D F
is acyclic. Certainly, jAj=2 is a tight upper bound on a minimum feedback
set and we can consider the parameterized problem which asks whether D has a
feedback arc set with at most jAj=2 k arcs. Fixed-parameter tractability of this
parameterized problem follows immediately from xed-parameter tractability
of LOALB, but we could prove this result directly using essentially the same
approach as for LOALB.</p>
      <p>Theorem 2.1 in [1] allows one to obtain a smaller kernel for LOALB on dense
digraphs than given in our paper. The proof of Theorem 2.1 in [1] also uses a
probabilistic approach, but it is more specialized than SABEM.</p>
      <p>It would be interesting to obtain applications of our method to other problems
parameterized above tight lower bounds or below tight upper bounds. One such
very recent application is given in [9], where an open problem due to Benny
Chor and described in [16] was solved.</p>
