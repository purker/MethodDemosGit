      <abstract>
        <p>Creating a concrete plan for preserving an institution's collection of digital objects requires the evaluation of available solutions against clearly defined and measurable criteria. Preservation planning aids in this decision making process to find the best preservation strategy considering the institution's requirements, the planning context and possible actions applicable to the objects contained in the repository. Performed manually, this evaluation of possible solutions against requirements takes a good deal of time and effort. In this demonstration, we present Plato, an interactive software tool aimed at creating preservation plans.</p>

      <title>Plato</title>
      <p>Plato1 implements the PLANETS2 Preservation Planning
approach [2] which provides a solid way of making informed
and accountable decisions on which solution to put into
practise in order to optimally preserve digital objects for a given
purpose. The tool is integrated into the PLANETS
Interoperability Framework based on open J2EE and web
technologies. Through this environment it integrates registries and
services for preservation action and characterisation through
flexible discovery and invocation.</p>
      <p>Characterisation services such as DROID3 and JHove4 are
used for format identification and property extraction; based
on this information, applicable action services such as
emulation tools or the migration services provided by CRiB[3] are
discovered through available registries. Comparison and
validation of objects as an essential feature of the system maps
the specified requirements such as essential object
characteristics to measurable criteria that can be compared

matically. It thus considerably improves the repeatability,
documentation and automation of preservation planning.</p>
      <p>Plato has been developed with very close attention to the
web user interface to not impose any technical restrictions
on the user when determining the requirements. Figure 1
shows the requirements for a preservation endeavour of a
web archive laid out in a tree structure. The tool offers a
fully flexible way to enable the specification of a wide range
of measurement scales. As the definition of requirements in
a tree structure is often done in a workshop setting, Plato
also supports tree import from mind-mapping software5.</p>
      <p>The applicability and usefulness of the tool has been
validated in a series of workshops and case studies which
involved various institutions [2, 1].</p>
