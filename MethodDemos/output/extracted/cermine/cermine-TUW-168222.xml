        <p>- Recent research results on communication science mention a relation between the interlocutor's perceptional preferences, his or her mental representations and his or her choice of expressions. However, there is not any tool for analyzing such. In my research I combined lexical with computational linguistic methods to develop a software prototype that is able to analyze text on the usage of perceptional expressions. This analyzing tool can help to identify the interlocutor's perceptional preference for easier meeting his or her way of thinking and thereby facilitate the understanding.</p>

      <title>I. INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>All communication is based on perception. With the
establishment of constructivism the knowledge about
individual differences in perception spread. It seems
reasonable to assume that the individual form of
perception also influences the language of a person.
Interestingly, this theory hasn’t yet shown great
affects in the research on individual and personal
language use.</p>
      <p>The Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP) offers a
model that seems as a first step in closing this gap:
The idea of sensual-specific perception which comes
noticeable in the individual language use is described
by the keyword “representational systems”.
According to this, every person has one or two sensory
systems preferably used to perceive his or her
environment. From the five senses arises the classification in
visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory and gustatory
perception modalities. Each of these perception
classes forms a sensomotor complex, in the NLP
called representational system. As the inner
representations are accessed for expressing thoughts, the
preferred sensory system of a speaker can be told by
his or her diction and wording.</p>
      <p>The research about the optimization of
communication furnished proof that the percentage of
understanding is higher when a speaker adjusts his diction
to the diction of his addressee – what applies with a
high probability also to the use of perceptional
words.</p>
      <p>Still, for the German language, not much research
on the relation between an individual’s perceptional
preference and his or her language use has been done
yet. To be able to go deeper into that idea, (1) a
lexical corpus of perceptional expressions and (2) a
software tool that automatically filters those
expressions from a text are needed. Those two steps shall
be explained in this abstract.</p>
      <p>II. A LEXICAL CORPUS OF PERCEPTIONAL</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>EXPRESSIONS</title>
      <p>
        For a systematic analysis of the use of perceptional
expressions, a corpus is needed, containing a
collection of the most often used words and expressions
that can be directly linked to one of the perceptional
classes mentioned above. That corpus was built with
the input of 13 different resources and contains more
than 840 different entries with at least 200 words and
expressions per perceptional class. For further details
and the complete corpus see [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>During the examination of the corpus it was found
that usually only the root word is decisive for the
assignment to a representational class, but that such a
root word can occur in different combinations. This
follows the fact that in the German language it is
possible to combine words and thereby create new
ones. That possibility causes a problem when
searching for a semantic unit that can also be part of a
compound word. For example, when searching for the
signal word “rot” [red], the output should also
include words like “Morgenrot” [dawn] and “rotgrün”
[red and green] containing the same semantic root,
but not words like “Brot” [bread] or “Schrot”
[bruised grain] which include the same sequence of
characters, but have no semantic link to the searched
word. A search algorithm that also takes compound
words into account would especially be helpful when
scanning a German text for a list of signal words.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a search algorithm using a new model
describing word composition was developed.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>III. THE ANALYZING TOOL</title>
      <p>As a consequence of the multiple combining
possibilities of root words, an appropriate analyzing tool
should not only be able to find the expressions
contained by the corpus, but also all possible
combinations that are based on the same semantic root.</p>
      <p>To solve this problem, a model of possible word
structures was developed. Following that model, it
can be determined which letters or syllables may
occur around a root word without changing its
semantic meaning (and hence the assignment to the
respective perceptional class). This model was
introduced with the aim to provide a clear description of
word composition transferable into an algorithm and,
based on the root word, describes the structure of
compound words as follows:
[ [prefix] + root word + [infix] + (word joint) ]
[prefix] + root word + [infix] + (ending)</p>
      <p>The following notation was used: Round brackets
mark optional, but maximal single occurrence, square
brackets highlight optional (even multiple)
occurrence of elements.</p>
      <p>
        Based on the word components mentioned in the
Duden Grammatik [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ], for each element of the model
a list of letter combinations was set up. The
analyzing tool joins the corpus of perceptional expressions
with the model of word structure and the lists of
possible word composition elements. After having
identified the searched sequence of characters in a
word, the algorithm analyzes the characters around it.
Step by step it checks whether the environment either
represents a semantically inseparable part of the
sequence of characters (which indicates a different
word meaning) or is the rest of a compound word
and thereby should be part of the output result.
      </p>
      <p>The tests with the tool let presume that the
occurrence of perceptional expression depends on the sort
of text and on the topic. A user’s test report on some
instant food i.e., had a very high rate of gustatory
vocabulary.</p>

      <title>IV. FURTHER RESEARCH</title>
      <p>At the moment I’m working on using this tool in user
modeling. As in the Internet (and esp. in blogs and
forums) there is quite a lot of text which can be
directly linked to a user, this could be a rich source for
modeling the user’s mental representations of
perceptional information. With such knowledge about the
user, advertisements with a higher acceptance can be
designed and chosen with respect to the user’s
individual perceptional preference.</p>
