        <p>Translating clinical practice guidelines into a computer-interpretable format is a challenging and laborious task. In this project we focus on supporting the early steps of the modeling process by automatically identifying conditional activities in guideline documents in order to model them automatically in further consequence. Therefore, we developed a rule-based, heuristic method that combines domain-independent information extraction rules and semantic pattern rules. The classification also uses a weighting coefficient to verify the relevance of the sentence in the context of other information aspects, such as effects, intentions, etc. Our evaluation results show that even with a small set of training data, we achieved a recall of 75 % and a precision of 88 %. This outcome shows that this method supports the modeling task and eases the translation of CPGs into a semi-formal model.</p>

      <p>
        Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are defined as “systematically developed
statements to assist practitioners and patient decisions about appropriate
healthcare for specific circumstances” [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ]. They include recommendations describing
appropriate care for the management of patients with a specific clinical
condition. An important part of CPG contents refers to the procedures to perform,
often formulated together with specific conditions that have to hold in order to
execute an activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        CPGs are published as textual guidelines, but in order to deploy them in some
kind of computerized tool (e.g., a reminder system or a more complex
decisionsupport system) they have to be represented in specialized languages (see [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref7">15, 7</xref>
        ]
for a comparison and overview). Although different authoring/editing tools are
often associated with these languages, authoring is a labor-intensive task that
requires comprehensive knowledge in medical as well as computer science.
      </p>
      <p>
        There have been several approaches to ease the modeling process, amongst
others by introducing intermediate representations that provide more
semi-structured and less formal formats. One of them is MHB, the Many-Headed Bridge
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
        ], that tries to bridge the gap between the guideline text and its corresponding
formalized model. It falls in the category of document-centric approaches [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>
        ]
and is devised to produce a non-executable XML document with the relevant
CPG fragments, starting from the original text. The knowledge of a CPG is
thereby represented in a series of chunks that correspond to a certain bit of
information in the CPG (e.g., a sentence, part of a sentence, more than one
sentence). The information in a chunk is structured in various dimensions, e.g.,
control flow, data flow. To additionally support the modeling task for non-IT
experts, MHB was further developed and split into MHB-F (free-text version)
and MHB-S (semantically enriched version) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ]. MHB-F now provides a very
simplified structure to make the modeling even for non-IT experts feasible and
to leave modeling details to knowledge engineers in a later step.
      </p>
      <p>In order to ease the laborious modeling, parts of the task should be automated
by applying information extraction methods. In this work we will focus on the
identification of condition-action sentences that form a prominent aspect of the
process flow in CPGs. The discovery of such combinations is not a trivial one.
On the one hand, condition-action sentences are rarely of the form ‘if condition
then action’, but require more sophisticated identification methods. On the other
hand, conditions may refer to effects, intentions, or events and not activities, and
these combinations have to be sorted out by our method. Table 1 shows a few
example sentences in regard to their MHB-F aspects.

        <title>Background and Related Work</title>
        <p>
          Guideline developers edit CPGs in a free-text format. In order to transform the
medical knowledge described in a guideline into execution models a translation
process is required. Moser and Miksch [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
          ] detected prototypical patterns in
freetext guidelines to bridge this gap. Serban et al. [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
          ] proposed an ontology-driven
extraction of linguistic patterns to pre-process a CPG in order to retrieve control
knowledge. The evaluation showed that the modeling as well as the authoring
process of guidelines was supported. Language engineering methods were used
in SeReMed [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
          ] to detect diagnoses or procedures in medical documents. The
method was successfully applied to X-ray reports. These documents however,
show a standardized structure and therefore are easier to handle by knowledge
engineering methods than CPGs. Taboada et al. [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
          ] identified relationships
between diagnoses and therapy entities in free-text documents by matching the
core information units of a sentence with a collection of predefined relationships
but the quality of this matching was not rated. To implement a rule based
approach to recognize medical entities the MeTAE (Medical Texts Annotation and
Exploration) platform was used by Abacha and Zweigenbaum [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
          ]. Additionally,
semantic relations between each pair of these entities were identified by means
of MetaMap [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
          ]. Consequently, relations between a problem (e.g., disease) and a
corresponding treatment were found. The method was applied to selected
articles and abstracts of PubMed but not to CPGs. In [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
          ] a heuristic-based approach
using information extraction methods independent of the final guideline
representation language was defined. This method was implemented and applied to
several guidelines containing a high amount of semi-structured text. The
adoption of this methodology on ’living-guidelines’ [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
          ] showed promising results. A
set of semantic patterns representing activities based on semantic relations was
generated by Kaiser et al. [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
          ] to identify medical activities in CPGs. Its
effectiveness was proved by a study which showed that a large part of control flow
related aspects could be identified. The relation between the activity and a
corresponding condition, however, was not part of the method but is an important
requirement for the future automatic translation of a guideline.

        <title>Methods</title>
        <p>Condition-based medical activities are expressed in clinical practice guidelines
in various ways and mostly found in single sentences. These sentences affect the
clinical pathway and therefore are relevant to the computer-interpretable model
of the guideline. In order to classify such a sentence as relevant, we based our
approach on the following hypothesis:
1. A sentence owns a certain domain independent linguistic structure, and
2. contains recurrent domain dependent semantic key patterns.</p>
        <p>We propose a rule-based, heuristic method using linguistic and semantic
patterns to classify sentences in CPGs as relevant for describing conditional
activities in order to move towards an automatic translation of such sentences into
MHB in a following future step (an example is shown in Figure 1). Therefore,
we analyzed a CPG document to develop a general linguistic pattern set and a
semantic pattern set based on UMLS Semantic Types. These pattern sets then
form the basis for the subsequent classification by calculating the relevance rate
(rr).

1. The Metathesaurus which is an aggregation of medical terms and codes of
different vocabularies (e.g., MeSH, SNOMED CT, etc.).
2. The Semantic Network which reduces the complexity of the Metathesaurus
by assigning semantic types to the concepts of the Metathesaurus in order
to group and define relationships among them.
3. The SPECIALIST Lexicon and Lexical Tools which provide natural language
processing tools.
The open source framework for text engineering GATE (Version 6) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
          ] allows
the combination of different text engineering components to develop reusable
applications. The following components were used in our method:
– ANNIE: A set of information extraction (IE) components, distributed within
the GATE system and relying on finite state algorithms and the JAPE
language [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
          ].
– OpenNLPChunker supports the detection of phrases within a parsed text.
– MetaMap Annotator: A tagger that maps biomedical texts to the UMLS
Metathesaurus and discovers Metathesaurus concepts and their semantic
types [

          ].

        <p>
          Manual Development of the General Linguistic Pattern Set
For the development of the general linguistic pattern set we used a chapter from
an Asthma guideline developed by SIGN [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
          ], where chapter 4: pharmacological
management had been modeled in the semi-structured modeling language
MHBF [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
          ] by a guideline modeling expert. We analyzed this chapter with regard to
the control flow aspects and started generating an initial linguistic pattern set
based on trigger words (12 occurrences for ’if’ and 4 occurrences for ’should’).
        </p>
        <p>In order to identify the semantic clauses of a sentence (these are the parts
describing the condition and the consequence), the patterns had to be grouped into
6 different patterns for ’if’ and 4 different patterns for ’should’ (some
straightforward patterns are listed in Table 2). Condition and consequence are distinguished
according to the sentence’s syntax, punctuation and its sequence of phrases. Two
complex examples including conditions spread over multiple phrases are shown
in Figure 2.</p>
        <p>We assigned a weighting factor to every pattern of the set - the value 0.5
to show that only a trigger word was found and 1.0 to express that also the
semantic clauses were identified. These constants can be adapted for new rule
types in the future.</p>

      <p>Legend: condition , consequence
Amongst the general syntactic patterns we also used semantic patterns based on
the UMLS Semantic Network. Therefore, we used the MetaMap plugin within
the GATE framework to automatically identify medical concepts in our text
and assign them to their corresponding UMLS concepts and semantic types
(represented by four-letter abbreviations - e.g., ’popg’ stands for ’Population
Group’). By this way it was possible to find out the sequence of semantic types
in the clauses of the sentences (see Figure 3).</p>

          Finally, the complete semantic abstraction of a sentence including rule type,
semantic clause type and sequence of semantic types was added to the semantic
pattern pool (see Table 3). A total of 32 entries was automatically generated.
The relevance rate rr is a measure to find out whether a sentence contains a
condition-action combination. Furthermore, it shall classify a sentence as crucial
for the clinical pathway in contrast to other information aspects like intentions
or explanations which are modeled in MHB-F in a different way. To find this
semantic difference the syntax of the sentences as well as their containing medical
semantic types must be respected. In order to calculate the relevance rate for
a selected sentence its semantic abstraction has to be generated and compared
with every entry in the semantic pattern pool. If the rule type and the semantic
clause type are matching, the similarity of the sequences of the semantic types
is calculated by using the Dice coefficient [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
          ]. The highest value is selected for
further calculation.
        </p>
        <p>In general, the value of the relevance rate rr is the sum of
– the weight(w) of the applied general IE rule, and
– the sum of the maximum similarity value (si) for each semantic clause of
the sentence divided by the number of semantic clauses (n) identified by the
general IE rules.</p>
        <p>n
rr = w + Pi=1 max{si} (1)
n
The weight of the IE rule and the arithmetic average of the similarity values
both in the range between 0 and 1 - have the same influence on the rr.</p>
        <p>The similarity value si of the semantic clause of a sentence and a matching
entry in the semantic pattern pool were calculated as follows:
– If the semantic clause contains only one semantic type it is compared to
those entries of the semantic pattern pool that also show only one semantic
type (to receive a better accuracy). In the case that both types are equal the
value for si is set to 1.0, otherwise
– both sequences of semantic types are interpreted as a string each and two
sets of 4-letter string bigrams are composed out of them. Subsequently, these
two sets are used for the calculation of the Dice coefficient.
Example:
Given are the sequence of semantic types of a new semantic clause S and the
sequence of semantic types of a matching entry of the semantic pattern pool P .
S: [fndg] [orgf] [qlco] [gngm] [phsu] and P : [strd] [gngm] [phsu] [ortf].
The resulting 4-letter string bigrams are:
S = {“f ndgorgf ′′, “orgf qlco′′, “qlcogngm′′, “gngmphsu′′}
P = {“strdgngm′′, “gngmphsu′′, “phsuortf ′′}.</p>
        <p>The Dice coefficent is defined as twice the shared information over the sum
of cardinalities:
si =</p>
        <p>2nt
ns + np
(2)
where nt corresponds to the number of bigrams found in both sets, ns is the
number of bigrams in S, and np the number of bigrams in P . So the result of
this example is s = 42+∗13 = 72 .</p>
        <p>
          The general interpretation of the rr is shown in Table 4.
The guidelines Management of active low-risk labour - Admission for Birth [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
          ]
(chapters 1, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3) and CBO Treatment of Breast Cancer (chapter
3) were applied to evaluate the method. These guidelines were intentionally
selected, because they cover a completely different medical application area in
contrast to the Asthma guideline and furthermore an MHB1 [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
          ] model already
existed, used as a “golden standard”.

applied to the guidelines and the identified sentences were annotated with the
semantic types retrieved from the UMLS via the MetaMap plugin. 50 sentences
were found which complied to the IE rules. Twenty out of the 50 sentences had
been modeled in MHB as control flow related aspects (activities based on special
medical conditions) and therefore their rr was expected to be higher than 1. The
other 30 sentences represented information about intentions and explanations in
MHB with an expected rr lower or equal 1. The evaluation results are shown in
Table 5 differentiated by the rule types.</p>
        <p>With the described method it was possible to identify 15 sentences which
correctly contained control flow related aspects. Only two sentences got an
incorrect rr higher than 1. They were not correctly rated, because they did not
describe condition-based activities. Other 5 sentences got an rr lower than 1
although their rr should have been higher as they contained condition-based
activities. Thus, the method had a recall of 75% and a precision of 88% (see
Table 6). The negative predictive value of 79% was higher than the recall value
and showed that 28 sentences had been correctly classified.</p>

into consideration. Additionally, 1 condition based activity could not be found,

        <title>Conclusions and Further Work</title>
        <p>
          The aim of this paper was to develop a method to identify condition-action
sentences. By defining a set of linguistic patterns we split up sentences semantically
- from one selected training guideline - into their clauses showing the condition
and the consequence. We used the UMLS Semantic Network [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
          ] to find out
which types of medical concepts were applied in these clauses. The outcome was
a semantic abstraction of every training sentence which then was stored in a
semantic pattern pool. This pool facilitated the classification of new sentences
regarding to their relevance to the corresponding MHB-F model expressed by
the measure relevance rate (rr).
        </p>
        <p>Modeling experts benefit from the method in two ways:
1. Condition-based activities in free-text guidelines, which must be modeled in</p>
        <p>MHB-F, are identified and rated.
2. These sentences are automatically split into the condition and the resulting
activity.</p>
        <p>An integration of the presented method into modeling tools will ease the work
of all parties involved.</p>
        <p>
          Ongoing steps will be (1) the implementation of additional information
extraction rules to expand the general linguistic pattern set in order to improve the
hit rate; (2) the extension of the semantic pattern pool with additional training
data in order to increase the significance of the relevance rate; (3) the
application of the method in the context of ’living-guidelines’ [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
          ]; (4) an investigation,
whether this method can support the modeling of processes also in other
application areas by substituting the UMLS SN by other domain dependent thesauri;
(5) the refinement of information extraction rules to make a step towards an
automatic translation of condition-based activities of free-text guidelines into the
modeling language MHB-F; and (6) the development of case studies to evidence
the effectiveness of the method in real-world scenarios. If it is possible to tap
the full potential of the presented method, the implementation of CPGs will be
fostered tremendously.
