        <p>A key problem in multimedia systems is the faithful reproduction of color. One of the main reasons why this is a complicated issue are the different color reproduction technologies used by the various devices; displays use easily modeled additive color mixing, while printers use a subtractive process, the characterization of which is much more complex than that of self-luminous displays. In order to resolve these problems several processing steps are necessary, one of which is accurate device characterization. Our study examines different learning algorithms for one particular neural network technique which already has been found to be useful in related contexts - namely radial basis function network models - and proposes a modified learning algorithm which improves the colorimetric characterization process of printers. In particular our results show that is possible to obtain good performance by using a learning algorithm that is trained on only small sets of color samples, and use it to generate a larger look-up table (LUT) through use of multiple polynomial regression or an interpolation algorithm. We deem our findings to be a good start point for further studies on learning algorithms used in conjunction with this problem.</p>

      <title>1. INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>In multimedia systems, different color reproduction devices — while serving the same purpose — exhibit large discrepancies
in their raw output. This is due to the fact that they usually employ different color mixing technologies (additive or subtractive),</p>
      <p>Correspondence: Email: artusi@cg.tuwien.ac.at
use different input color spaces and hence have different gamuts, and that their device characteristics can change with time and
usage. These facts usually do not permit a faithful matching of colors between devices if no precautions are taken.</p>
      <p>Colorimetric characterization is one step in the colorimetric reproduction process that permits faithful image reproduction
across different display devices. Its goal is to define a mapping function between the device–dependent color spaces in question
(such as RGB or CMYK) and device–independent color spaces (such as CIELAB or CIEXYZ), and vice versa.</p>
      <p>There are three main approaches to defining this mapping function: physical models, empirical models and exhaustive
measurements. Physical modeling of imaging devices involves building mathematical models that find a relationship between
the colorimetric coordinates of the input (or output) image element and the signals used to drive an output device (or the
signals originating from an input device). The advantage of these approaches is that they are robust, typically require few
colorimetric measurements in order to characterize the device, and allow for easy recharacterization if some component of the
imaging system is modified. The disadvantage is that the models are often quite complex to derive and can be complicated to
implement. Physical models are often used for the colorimetric characterization of displays and scanners.</p>
      <p>Empirical modeling of imaging devices involves collecting a fairly large set of data and then statistically fitting a
relationship between device coordinates and colorimetric coordinates. Empirical models are often higher–order multidimensional
polynomials, or neural network models. They require fewer measurements than LUT techniques, but they need more than
physical models. Empirical models are often used for scanners and printers.</p>
      <p>Often the colorimetric characterization of printers requires an exhaustive measurement in order to obtain good performances.
Typically samples of the device drive signals are sampled and colorimetrically measured. Many more measurements
have to be used for devices with poor repeatability.</p>
      <p>Lookup tables can be used to process image data via multidimensional interpolation. This technique has different
disadvantages: the large number of measurements that has to be made, difficulties in interpolating the highly nonlinear data and difficult
recharacterization if any aspect of the device changes. The advantage of exhaustive measurement techniques is that they require
no knowledge of the device physics.</p>
      <p>In general a good algorithm for colorimetric characterization must have the following characteristics: small training set,
fast response, good accuracy and it must allow for a fast recharacterization. This paper proposes a modification of an existing
learning algorithm to train radial basis function networks to solve the problem discussed so far, namely the colorimetric
characterization of printers. This learning algorithm has fast training and test phases, good accuracy, and it also requires a
comparatively small training set.</p>
      <p>In section 2 we discuss related previous work, section 3 describes the background for radial basis function networks, the
models used in our experiments, and the proposed new model. Section 4 explains how the training and test set were generated
and reports some experimental results.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>2. STATE OF THE ART</title>
      <p>There is a large number of publications on the colorimetric characterization of printers that propose different models for
solving this problem: Kang and Anderson propose the application of neural networks and polynomial regression. Albanese,
Campadelli and Schettini and Tominaga have used feed–forward neural networks trained by back–propagation and obtained
promising results. However, their approach also has some disadvantages: the need for a big training set (several hundred to
several thousand samples), high computational cost, and a comparatively large maximum color error for high quality color
reproductions. One of these problems has been solved by Artusi, Campadelli and Schettini : in their work they reduced the
size of the training set to 216 measured samples, while retaining a maximum error that is comparable to — in some cases even
better than — previous approaches.</p>
      <p>There are no references to be found in the literature about the use of radial basis function networks for the colorimetric
characterization of printers, but there is a wealth of other publications about them and their applications (such as Orr, Bishop,
Carozza and Lee ).</p>
      <p>The work we present is novel in seven ways: to begin with, this is the first work that uses radial basis function networks
to resolve the colorimetric characterization of printers. Second, we used a new learning model to train such networks; our
approach is based on a modification of the proposal by Carozza. Third, we use only 125 measured samples for the training
of the network. Fourth, the computational costs for this training are very low when compared to previous techniques and allow
to use this model in consumer products. Fifth, it is a general model which one can also use to define other transformations
between color spaces. Sixth, it is possible to have a fast recharacterization of the device because the computational cost of the
training phase is low. Finally, it improves on the performance of multiple polynomial regression and tetrahedral interpolation.</p>

      <title>3. BACKGROUND</title>
      <p>There are two main types of regression problems in statistics : parametric and non–parametric. In parametric regression the
form of the functional relationship between the dependent and independent variables is known, but may contain parameters
whose values are unknown, and it is possible to successfully estimate the desired result from the training set.</p>
      <p>In the case of non–parametric regression there is no, or very little, a priori knowledge about the form of the true function
which is being estimated. The colorimetric characterization problem, presented in these papers, is a non–parametric regression
problem, because one does not know the mapping function properties the algorithm will arrive at in advance. There are
different approaches to resolve non–parametric regression problems; when one uses equation systems in this context they may
contain many free parameters that have no physical meaning in the problem domain (interpolation models, multiple polynomials
regression), or one can use neural networks instead.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>3.1. Neural networks</title>
      <p>The base of a neural network is a formal neuron. It is defined as a series of inputs, a series of outputs and by a function that
maps specific inputs to series of outputs. Neural networks consist of collections of connected formal neurons. Each formal
neuron computes a simple nonlinear function F on the weighted sum of its input. The function F is referred to as activation
function and its output is defined as the activation of the formal neuron. Long term knowledge is stored in the network in the
form of interconnection weights that link such formal neurons.</p>
      <p>There are different neural network structures : total connected networks, partial connected networks, multilayer networks
(feedforward, feedback), and autoassociative networks. In a neural network, the learning phase is a process where a set of
weights are defined that produces a desired response as a reaction to certain input patterns. There are two main techniques
for the learning phase: supervised learning and non–supervised learning. In supervised learning the function is learned from
samples which a “teacher” supplies. This set of samples, referred to as the training set, contains elements which consist of paired
values of the independent (input) variable and the dependent (output) variable. In the case of non–supervised learning, it
reaches an internal model that captures the regularity in the inputs without taking other information into account.</p>
      <p>can be expressed in the following form :</p>
      <p>The model is expressed as a linear combination of a set of m fixed functions, often referred to as basis functions. The
flexibility of , its ability to fit many different functions, derives only from the freedom to choose different values for the
weights. The basis functions and any parameters which they might contain are fixed. If the basis function parameters can also
change during the learning process, the model is considered non–linear. Any set of functions can be used as a basis set, although
it is desirable that they are differentiable. There are many different classes of functions that one can use as basis functions, for
example:</p>

      <title>3.3. Radial basis function networks</title>
      <p>Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFn) are derived from the exact interpolation problem by introduction of several changes.
The exact interpolation problem attempts to map every input point exactly onto a corresponding target point. The Radial Basis
Function (RBF) approach introduces a set of basis functions equal to the number of input points. Furthermore, the following
modifications are necessary for the introduction of RBFns:
" forward to basis functions whose outputs are linearly combined with weights into the network output. This example could
An example of a traditional RBFn with one hidden layer is shown in figure 1. Each of components of the input vector feeds
be a linear model of RBFn if the parameters of the basis function , in the hidden layer, do not change during the learning
process. Instead if they change during the learning process the RFBn is non-linear. Also if there is more than one hidden layer
of basis functions in the structure of the RBFn the network is a non-linear model. There are two stages for the training
phase: determining the basis function parameters, and the finding of appropriate weights.</p>
      <p>The number of basis functions does not have to be the same as the number of input points, and is typically smaller.</p>
      <p>The bias parameters are included in the sum term of the linear model from equation (1).</p>
      <p>In the case of a non–linear model there are two more modifications if the basis function can move, change size, or if there is
more than one hidden layer:</p>
      <p>There is no constraint that the centers of basis functions have to be input points; instead, determining these centers is part
of the training process.</p>

weights, in matrix notation, are:
In the case of a linear model, the parameters of the basis functions are fixed, and the goal is to minimize the sum of the squared
errors in order to obtain the optimal weights vector :
where is referred to as design matrix and is the output of the RBF, is the covariance matrix of the weights , and
the matrix is the output target. In many cases this amounts to an over–fitting problem, and the main effect of this is that the
neural network loses its generalization capacity. In order to counter the effects of over–fitting it is possible to utilize results
from regularization theory. Regularization theory suggests to attach a term called regularization parameter in equation (6), in
order to obtain a weight vector which is more robust against noise in the training set. In regularization theory, there are two
main techniques: global ridge regression, where one uses unique regularization parameters for all basis functions, and local
ridge regression, where there is a regularization parameter for every basis function. For the case of global ridge regression one
has to modify equation (6) as follows:

One way to give linear models the flexibility of non–linear models is to go through a process of selecting a subset of basis
functions from a larger set of candidates. In linear regression theory subset selection is well known and one popular
added to the network. The basis function to add is the one which most reduces the sum squared errors in equation (6); this is
repeated until no further improvements are made. There are different criterions to decide when to stop the forward selection
process: generalised cross-validation (GCV), unbiased estimate of variance (UEV), final predictor error (FPE) and the
Bayesian information criterion (BIC).</p>

      <title>3.6. Non–linear network models</title>
      <p>In the non–linear model the basis function parameters are not fixed, and it is possible to estimate them during the learning
process. This gives more flexibility to the network model. In literature there is a large number of publications that propose
different models to estimate these basis function parameters. In this section we present two existing models, also used in our
experiments . In particular we present in detail the model of Carozza, in order to understand the differences with the model
presented in this paper. In Carozza a new algorithm for function approximation from noisy data was presented. The authors
proposed an incremental supervised learning algorithm for RBFn. It added a new node at every step of the learning process,</p>
      <p>where is a random number in a fixed range
technique. A population of individuals is generated by applying the mutation

concept of robust RBFs and makes suggestions on how to choose a function candidate which fulfils this role.</p>

      <p>In particular we have modified the estimation of the weights by
introducing a pseudoinverse matrix instead of using the extend chained version of the Nadaraja–Watson estimator for updating
the weights. The pseudoinverse method works by resolving the following general system of linear equations:

based on the following theorem of linear algebra: any matrix whose number of rows is greater than or equal its
number of columns , can be written as the product of an column–orthogonal matrix , an diagonal matrix

Matlab.

    <sec id="sec-14">
      <title>5.2. Results</title>
      <p>The first step in our research was to find a good learning algorithm to train the RBFn function with small training sets. In order
to do this we evaluated different learning algorithms in the following order: first linear models with forward selection without
and with local ridge regression (GCV, UVE, FPE, BIC ); we used the Matlab implementation of these algorithms by
Orr. Then we considered nonlinear models as proposed by Lee and Carozza ; we implemented these ourselves in C.
Our proposed own non-linear model was again implemented in Matlab. All these algorithms were then compared to multiple
polynomial regression and tetrahedral interpolation.</p>
      <p>When we wanted to find out whether a particular learning algorithm is adequate to solve the posed problem, we first tested it
only for the conversion CMY CIELAB on an Epson Stylus Pro5000, and only if this preliminary test turned out favourably,
we conducted further experiments on other printers and with the conversion CIELAB CMY. In every table of the columns
for the training and test sets we show the average error on the left and the maximum error on the right of the respective cells.</p>
      <p>We began the experiments by initially testing existing learning algorithms, specifically those proposed by Golub, Efron,
Mallows and Schwarz on the color printer Epson Stylus Pro 5000; we used two training sets (labeled Training1 and
Training2 in the tables) and tested the networks with a set labeled Test. The results for linear model with forward selection and
without ridge regression are shown in table 1 for the function CMY CIELAB.</p>
      <p>Our results demonstrate that this model is already able to improve on the performance of multiple polynomial regression for
polynomials with up to 60 terms and tetrahedral interpolation, shown in table 3, in the case of the set Training1. However, this
does not extend to the set Training2, where the unmodified RBFn approach fares no better than the conventional techniques.
This is probably due to the fact that in this case the network encounters over–fitting problems as mentioned in section 3.4. In
order to resolve this problem we have tried to use regularization theory (local and global ridge regression), but this failed to
improve the results. These results are shown in the table 2.</p>
      <p>Another approach was to generate more training sets with smaller numbers of samples compared to the original large set
Training1. We produced two such sets in the way suggested by Moroni, labeled Training3 and Training4, with 392 and 252
samples respectively. Results from test runs with these sets are reported in table 6, for multiple polynomial regression, instead
for RBFn linear models with forward selection without local ridge regression, and with local ridge regression in the tables 4
and 5 respectively. These results show that there are indeed improvements with respect to multiple polynomial regression with
the set Training3, and equal performance with Training4.</p>
      <p>However, compared to the still large size of the new reduced training sets the improvement is rather small. The
methodology for generation of the condensed training set proposed by Moroni apparently does not allow for the desired increase in
efficiency.</p>
      <p>In this phase of the experiments we also tried other innovative learning algorithms found in literature (such as Lee and
Carozza ), but the results we obtained were of poor quality. We then altered our strategy and decided to modify an existing
learning algorithm. Our the choice here has been to modify the learning algorithm proposed by Carozza, mainly because it
does not get significantly more complex when it is modified, and also because it does not have inherent convergence problems
like the algorithm of Lee. The results we obtained are shown in tables 7 and 8; the tests were done on an Epson Stylus
Pro5000 for the function CMY CIELAB.</p>
      <p>The results show how it is possible to obtain performance that is better than that of multiple polynomial regression and
tetrahedral interpolation with only 125 samples. This is shown in the last two columns beginning at the right of table 3 for both
sets (Training and Test) and both error metrics (average and maximum). In order to make sure that these results are consistently
reproducible over time we repeated the experiment in May, June and July, and used different (but similar) sets of 125 training
samples in each case; the progression of the error over time is shown in table 8. The results are in line with the first experiment
reported in table 7. In order to validate our model we performed similar tests on two more ink-jet color printers from other
manufacturers, namely a HP2000C and an Olivetti Artjet20. The results are shown in table 9 for the Epson Stylus Pro5000,
in table 10 for the HP2000C and in table 11 for the Olivetti Artjet20. The data is also compared against results from multiple
polynomial regression; all tests were done for the function CMY CIELAB.</p>
      <p>The results show that there is an improvement over multiple polynomial regression for every ink-jet color printer. The
results shown in the tables 9 to 11 demonstrate that our model has general validity.</p>
      <p>The final problem we discuss in this paper is the definition of the function CIELAB CMY using our model; now the main
problem is that of the definition of a suitable termination condition for the learning process. If we use the same condition that
we used for the definition of the function CMY CIELAB and compute the error in CIELAB space, is necessary to use the
inverse transformation for each termination check, which in turn also implies that a neural network for this inverse case ought
to be used. This solution is not feasible because the computational cost of the inverse network training phase is significant, and
too much accuracy is lost through the repeated conversions. Neither is it possible to compute the error in CMY space, because
this approach is inherently incapable of knowing when to stop the learning process.</p>
      <p>The solution that we have adopted has been to generate a LUT with 729 uniform samples in CMY space with our type of
RBF network, which was trained with 125 samples. We then used this LUT with multiple polynomial regression on the set
Test. We compared this result to the result obtained with a LUT of 729 uniform samples, which were printed and measured
from CMY space, and which were also used with multiple polynomials regression on the same set of samples. The results are
reported in table 12; this test was performed on an ink–jet printer of the type Epson Stylus Pro5000.</p>
      <p>These results show that is possible to generate a LUT from only 125 initial printed and measured samples with our method,
compared to 729 samples used by multiple polynomial regression or interpolation models. Our model permits a fast
recharacterization of ink–jet color printers because it needs only 125 printed and measured samples, and in addition its training phase is
very fast. On a 500 MHz Pentium II Celeron system with 128 Mbytes of RAM the training time with the initial 125 samples is
in the order of a few minutes, and the time it takes to generate the 729 entry LUT is one additional minute.</p>

      <title>6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</title>
      <p>We have presented a new learning algorithm, which is a modification of a known technique, that trains the RBFn model for
the colorimetric characterization of color printers. Our algorithm needs a training set of only 125 samples in order to train the
RBFn. With this model is even possible to generate a LUT of 729 samples, beginning with only 125 printed and measured
samples, and to use this LUT with other standard algorithms of colorimetric characterization.</p>
      <p>The computational cost is very low in the training and testing phases, and is even better than the performance of other
standard colorimetric characterization models (multidimensional polynomials regression an tetrahedral interpolation). It is our
opinion that the results suggest that may be possible to use this algorithm in consumer products, because we have been able to
resolve the two problems that has so far limited the more widespread use of such methods: high computational cost, and the
large number of training samples needed. The small size of the training set also permits a fast recharacterization of devices.</p>
      <p>We believe that there are several possible ways to evolve these models for colorimetric characterization problems:
investigation of different mathematical models for the estimation of the basis function parameters, research on different mathematical
models for the estimation of the weights, introduction of one or two more hidden layers in the structure of the RBFn, and
eventually experiments that involve combinations of these new techniques.
