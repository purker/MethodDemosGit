        <p>Medical practitioners often have unmet information needs that impact patient care. However, currently available web-based search engines are not suitable for routine use. Finding relevant information takes too long, assessing the trustworthiness of found information is difficult, and support for the heterogeneity of languages and nomenclature across European countries is lacking. In this paper, we analyze the current barriers to web-based searching by medical practitioners and introduce the European Khresmoi project, which aims to dismantle these barriers.</p>

      <title>1. Background</title>
      <p>
        Physicians often have unmet information needs. These have been reported as occurring for up to 2
of every 3 patients seen [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ], or more recently for 41% of the questions they pursued [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ]. Although
these medical professionals have many tools for information search available (such as PubMed),
studies have revealed that they do not use them to their full capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most questions arise during consultations and have a direct impact on the medical decision process
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ]. There is evidence suggesting that physicians primarily respond to their information needs when
they perceive the question to be urgent and believe that definitive answers can be found [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ].
However, physicians are often restricted in their search by time constraints [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ]. Physicians search
on average for less than 5 minutes to answer questions [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ]. A so-called “90 second rule” has been
described in the literature — meaning physicians do not even attempt to find information unless
they think they can do it in a minute and a half [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ]. Hence, it is important that the pertinent
information is found during this time. However, the time taken to answer questions using PubMed
averages 30 minutes [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ] and the information found is often scattered over multiple articles, making
PubMed searching impractical for routine clinical use [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ]. Furthermore, physicians that are not
native English speakers using systems in English language are prone to use erroneous search terms,
resulting in poorer returned results [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        The World Wide Web has a lot to offer in terms of both quantity and quality of medical
information [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ]. There is no consensus within the literature as to what extent doctors currently rely
on web-based searching as compared to other information sources. One line of research suggests
that physicians often find it quicker and easier to look up answers in a pocket reference book or ask
a colleague for advice [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ] rather than searching on the Internet. In addition current web-based
solutions fail to provide psychological support, guidance, affirmation, sympathy, judgement, and
feedback, which colleagues can provide within the daily decision making process of a physician. A
review by Davies [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ] compared relevant research between 2000 and 2005, and found that text
books (39%) and colleagues (25%) were the information sources physicians accessed most
frequently, while computer resources were used only by 13%. However, an upward trend of
Internet use is visible as the highest percentage of use examined in the study, 53%, occurred in the
latest published research from 2005. A Spanish study published in 2007 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ] found that the
majority of physicians still relied on colleagues, drug compendiums and textbooks rather than on
web-based resources. A possible explanation is language as a potential barrier to web-based
searching, and it appears to be inadequately addressed by current web-based solutions within the
medical domain. In contrast to these findings is research claiming a clear preference of the Internet
as a primary informational resource amongst physicians [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
        ],[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
        ]. Both studies provide support for
the notion that the Internet has become an important information source amongst physicians.
Possible explanations of conflicting study outcomes could be the variance among medical
specialities, different geographical locations and potential biases introduced by different
methodologies used in the studies (e.g., user observations versus self reports). Furthermore, the
rapid changes and advances in the field of information technology make comparisons over larger
time spans difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also conflicting data about which web sites and tools physicians use to look for medical
information on the web. Some publications suggest that general-purpose search services such as
Google can play a useful role in the medical decision making process [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
        ],[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        ]. In contrast, Leo et.
al. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
        ] reported that physicians mistrust the quality of results from such search engines and prefer
to directly access specialized medical websites. A study by Yu and Kaufman [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
        ] suggests that
Google is preferred for finding medical definitions, as it is easy to use and provides good answers
to simple questions. However, for more complex information needs more advanced search systems
may be required. A recent study funded by Google [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
        ] is in strong contrast with prior findings. It
postulates that the majority of physicians use Google or a similar search engine as their primary
information sources in the clinical decision making process. However, it is unclear as to what
extent the study was biased in terms of sample selection. Another study showed that general
practitioners use Google as their first information source, primarily to lead them to higher quality
websites [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ]. Thus, it appears that physicians are currently willing to use a search engine for
simple questions and as an initial source to help them find their way to higher quality websites.

      <title>2. The Khresmoi approach</title>
      <p>Summarizing the issues described above, medical practitioners could benefit from a widely
deployed search engine that:
● provides relevant, summarised output, yielding answers to complex questions in just a few
minutes
● is openly available on the web without barriers (e.g., requirement of subscription,
registration fees)
● is multilingual and supports terminologies (e.g., drug brand names in various countries)
● is fast, easy to use and can be viewed on mobile devices
● is developed in close cooperation with medical practitioners
● is able to deal with short and underspecified queries
● is continuously kept up-to-date
● responds to the need for psychological support and affirmation
It is the aim of the Khresmoi project5 to design and build a search engine that meets these criteria.
The project is executed by a consortium of 12 academic and industrial partners and has a budget of
approximately € 10 million. It started in September 2010 and will run for four years. Incremental
versions will be made available during the project. Results of interviews and questionnaires about
search engine use and information needs of European medical practitioners will be available by
mid-2011. A first prototype will be released after one year, the final stable version of the
infrastructure will be released in 2014.</p>
      <p>
        Khresmoi aims to meet the needs of a variety of users (Fig. 1): Members of the general public that
do not have any medical expertise, as well as medical practitioners within their specialities, and
radiologists (which form a separate user group because of their distinct information needs).
The prototype system is based on existing software tools developed by the consortium partners.
The GATE framework [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
        ] is used for natural language processing, information extraction and the
automated annotation of biomedical entities mentioned in websites and articles. The crawling,
processing and querying of several terabytes of medical literature from web sources is done by the
Vienna-based Information Retrieval Facility6 (IRF). To query both unstructured and
semistructured, annotated text, the Mímir information retrieval engine7 is employed. Mímir is able to
recognize and normalize linguistic variants, different units of measurement, annotations and
document sections. It provides a sophisticated query language based on these text features. Mímir is
interlinked with and complemented by the BigOWLIM semantic repository8, a highly scalable
storage and reasoning system for data in RDF/OWL9 format. BigOWLIM is used to house a large
medical knowledge base composed of biomedical ontologies (such as those from the Unified
Medical Language System, UMLS10) and relevant medical and pharmacological datasets harvested
from the web of data .
      </p>
      <p>The quality of medical websites used by the Khresmoi system is ensured by Health on the Net11
(HON). HON is a non-governmental organization that gives a certificate (the 'HONcode') to
trustworthy medical websites, based on a rigorous check of the website content. The HONcode is
among the most widely acknowledged quality certificates for medical information on the web.
The project has a dedicated budget of around 120,000 Euros for the manual creation of annotations
on professional medical literature, which will add rich contextual information and raise the data
quality.</p>
      <p>The ability to query over an integrated database of annotated text from medical websites and
literature, biomedical ontologies and well-structured biomedical datasets is expected to improve the
quality of search results, and to reduce the time that is needed to find relevant, valid answers to
medical questions.</p>
      <p>Of course, such a system needs to be designed in close collaboration with the targeted group of end
users. The Society of Physicians in Vienna12 is a member of the Khresmoi consortium and
responsible for guiding project developments according to the needs of European medical
practitioners. The society has over 2400 members and around 200 new members join each year.
The website of the society is one of the leading Austrian websites for continuing medical education.
It offers an online library, courses, webcasts, podcasts, as well as mobile services for physicians. In
the Khresmoi project, the Society of Physicians conducts a large-scale user study to gather current
data about the use of web-based information sources by medical practitioners in Austria and other
European countries, employing both qualitative and quantitative methodologies (interviews and
questionnaires). The study will serve to gather user requirements for the development of the
Khresmoi system. Furthermore, the society will evaluate and test the initial and final versions of the
Khresmoi search engine amongst its members.</p>

      <title>3. Conclusions</title>
      <p>The Khresmoi project is at an early stage. In order to increase the uptake of web-based search
systems by medical practitioners and to have a meaningful impact on medical decision making, the
development of the system needs to be done in close collaboration with medical practitioners. The
community of physicians in Vienna could spearhead the uptake of web-based decision support in
the daily medical routine.</p>
