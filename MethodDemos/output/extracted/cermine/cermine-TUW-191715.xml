        <p>In this paper we give an overview of the current research trends and explore the challenges in several subfields of the scientific discipline of computer graphics: interactive and photorealistic rendering, scientific and information visualization, and visual analytics. Five challenges are extracted that play a role in each of these areas: scalability, semantics, fusion, interaction, acquisition. Of course, not all of these issues are disjunct to each other, however the chosen structure allows for a easy to follow overview of the concrete future challenges.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Computer graphics studies methods for producing digital images of data
with the goal to communicate computer output to a human user in the form of
pictures. The visual input channel has by far the broadest bandwidth of all our
senses and therefore enables the most effective transport of information from
computers to humans. Production includes synthesizing, manipulating and
displaying the underlying data. The data may be almost any content one can
think of: geometric or other spatial data just as well as statistical data,
simulation results or abstract data, all real or virtual. Roughly speaking, the
ultimate goal of rendering research is to create perfectly realistic looking
realtime images of real-world objects, whereas visualization tries to create images
of data and structures that are otherwise invisible to the human eye or
completely abstract.</p>
      <p>Computer graphics has been among the most successful computer
science fields during the last three decades and the methods and results
available today have exceeded the expectations by far. Therefore some people
consider most computer graphics problems as solved, providing a ready to use
set of tools for applications. But while this is true for some areas with simple
use of computer images, the embedding of computer graphics technology in
increasingly complex surroundings generates many new challenges.</p>
      <p>
        Usage of computer graphics is embedded in more and more
complicated environments, making its combined use with other technologies
more and more natural, so that many people talk about disciplines growing
together. Such fields are computer vision, image processing, pattern
recognition, tracking, scanning, video augmentation, information theory, user
interface design, large data bases and several more. Multiple articles in the past
decades have extracted future research problems in various subfields of
computer graphics, e.g. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ],…,[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ]. In this article we will describe the research
trends of the coming years based on five major challenges that are common to
all computer graphics sub-fields. These are:
      </p>
      <p>1. Scalability = how to cope with huge amounts of data, highly parallel
computers and distributed devices.</p>
      <p>2. Semantics = how can meaning be extracted from data and context
and be used for better insight.</p>
      <p>3. Fusion = how can multiple techniques, data streams, and models be
combined to solve complex problems.</p>
      <p>4. Interaction = how to combine multiple and ubiquitous input devices
to create ergonomic user interfaces.</p>
      <p>5. Acquisition = how can data from various input sources be processed
to deal with missing data, contradictions, and uncertainty.</p>
      <p>These challenges are often interdependent to some degree. For example,
semantics can assist scalability by determining features that can be left away at a
given level of detail, and acquisition by allowing a meaningful extrapolation of
missing data and resolution of contradictions; petascale data will require new
interaction metaphors and acquisition and data processing methods. Consequently,
any research in these areas will typically cross boundaries and cannot be strictly
attributed to a single challenge. Still, this discrimination facilitates the following
description of the specific aspects of each challenge.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>2. Scalability</title>
      <p>2.1. Challenges in Scalability</p>
      <p>The challenges posed by the enormous amount of data generated by
current and especially future acquisition techniques will require fundamental
research on scalable algorithms, techniques, and systems. For example, the 3D
reconstruction of entire cities from thousands of high-resolution aerial
photographs and laser range scans, or the 3D volumes of brain tissue obtained
via electron microscopy in current research in neurobiology both result in data
sizes in the terabyte (1000 GB) to petabyte (1000 TB) range per data set. This
magnitude is commonly referred to as petascale data. However, many existing
methods are designed for a relatively narrow range of data sizes and
characteristics, and are not directly applicable to the enormous requirements of
petascale computer graphics. Another example are desktop computers which
currently have four to eight CPU cores, and they will likely have tens or
hundreds of CPUs in the near future. How do we adapt our methods in
computer graphics to use this processing power?</p>
      <p>In addition to handling and visualizing petascale data, computations
such as 3D reconstruction, segmentation, object identification, and the
generation of derived data must also be able to operate on this new order of
magnitude. Possible solutions lie in the parallelization and distribution of
computation and visualization, exploiting all levels of non-uniform
architectures. The possibilities offered by the architectural levels of multi-core
CPUs, GPUs, shared and distributed memory architectures, clusters for
computation and visualization, and remote visualization and computation must
be exploited in a coherent and scalable manner. This also necessitates
aggressive multi-resolution approaches that work on a huge range of scales,
while preserving important features and considering application and user
semantics.</p>
      <p>The overall challenge of future scalable systems ties in with the
requirements of semantic interfaces and navigation through the enormous
spread of scales in petascale data. The underlying algorithms must be
scalable to different kinds and different levels of expertise of users, such as
their specific knowledge about a given problem domain, e.g., geophysics,
medicine, or neurobiology. This requires techniques to be able to supply
quick but accurate overviews and deliver additional detail on demand, while
preserving features of interest over a huge range of scales. With petascale
data, millions of data elements can map to the same screen pixel of the
output device. Handling this scalability challenge in a meaningful way that
preserves application or user semantics, and enables users to actually work
with data on this order of magnitude is one of the most crucial and
fundamental scalability issues.</p>
      <p>Future computer graphics methods must be scalable with respect to
widely varying output devices such as high-end workstations, thin clients and
the web, depending on user and application requirements, location and
preferences. They must support single users as well as remote collaboration, and
the corresponding heterogeneous display and input techniques.</p>
      <p>2.2. Scalability Challenges in Visualization and Visual Analytics</p>
      <p>
        Microscopic scans of the human body comprise tera- and petabytes of
data. Using multiple GPUs and processors will allow real-time visualization of
this huge volume data. This is a requirement for analyzing and understanding
the functionality of the human body. Other examples in large data visualization
can be found in rendering [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ], storing and processing [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ], transmitting [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ], and
exploiting multiple CPUs [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ] or GPUs [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ]. However, increasing data sizes and
new hardware architectures demand much more research in scalable
visualization [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>The development of scalable visualization algorithms and systems is
one of the most fundamental future challenges in visualization. The main
reasons for this are the enormous increase in data sizes that are routinely
generated by high-resolution acquisition technologies such as Electron
Microscopy; the variety of different data sources that need to be visualized and
analyzed concurrently; and the amount of additional derived data that often
need to be computed from the raw input data. Therefore, the main topics of
research on scalability in this field are:
− Distributed and out-of-core visualization;
− Approaches that exploit massively parallel CPU and GPU architectures;
− Progressive, feature-preserving multi-resolution techniques;
− Achieving scalability for users by integrating semantics (see also challenge
semantics).</p>
      <p>2.3. Scalability Challenges in Rendering and Virtual Reality</p>
      <p>New road construction projects produce terabytes of data that may be
used for urban planning including municipal decisions. By using levels-of-detail
and out-of-core rendering, computer graphics has to provide interactive
rendering tools to enable the affected parties to compare different road variants
and decide on the plan with the least impact on the environment.</p>
      <p>Due to the extremely large amounts of geometry that are provided for
rendering in many projects, scalability with respect to the amount of data is one
of the most urgent needs in rendering. In view of the ongoing trend towards
mobile devices, it will also become increasingly important to support a wide
variety of output devices, ranging from hand-held devices with small screen
sizes, all the way to video-walls consisting of multiple monitors or projectors.</p>
      <p>
        The most obvious but also often difficult way to achieve this scalability
is to make use of parallel or distributed computing resources. One of the most
promising developments for being able to exploit future highly parallel and
distributed hardware is the recent or expected inclusion of functional
programming paradigms into mainstream languages [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ]. One of the tenets of
functional programming is its ultimate parallelizability. Employing these new
programming paradigms will therefore make it possible to rearrange large
portions of the rendering pipeline to work in a purely functional manner and
thus considerably reduce the complexity of creating highly parallelized or
distributed rendering applications.
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>3. Semantics</title>
      <p>3.1. Challenges in Semantics</p>
      <p>In addition to the algorithmic challenge of handling the huge amounts
of data that will have to be processed in future applications, the interpretation
and analysis of this data will require additional semantic information. For
example, large laser range scans of urban environments will only be useful for
analysis if buildings and surface types are recognized and correspondingly
marked. Another example, laser range scanners provide huge amounts of
unstructured point clouds. How can semantic information be added to the data
that characterizes the structures and objects that were scanned? All types of
medical imaging techniques like MRI and CT will enormously benefit if
adequate segmentation based on semantics is applied. Also huge amounts of
abstract information such as financial data-sets will require that semantic
information is included and visualized to support a quick and reliable analysis.</p>
      <p>If all of these data sets are enriched with semantic information, it will
be possible to formulate intelligent queries that retrieve subsets of the data that
meet certain semantic criteria. Further processing of the data will be able to
choose appropriate techniques based on semantic information, e.g. in laser
range data sets vegetation, buildings, and terrain may be processed differently,
and in medical imaging the processing of volume data sets can vary based on
the organ or physiological process that has been imaged. Semantic information
can be based on the underlying data, but also on the analysis goal, the
application scenario, use history or the user profile.</p>
      <p>Visualization and rendering of such semantically enriched data sets can
use this information to provide different visualization methods and views of the
data based on the context: analysis of the data requires different strategies
compared to presentation for larger audiences. Semantic information can also be
used to compress huge data sets and reduce transmission costs in distributed
setups. Given these benefits that can be realized if semantic information is
available, the challenge for the field of computer graphics is three-fold: to
research and develop the appropriate methods to extract semantic information
from huge, heterogeneous unstructured data sets. Based on the area of
application a number of different techniques such as atlases, refined matching
methods and codification and sharing of insight will have to be used; to find
appropriate data structures for semantic information that make it possible to
refine and enhance the knowledge base as additional data becomes available;
and finally to extend existing methods to make optimal use of semantic
information in rendering and visualization. This requires novel, tightly
integrated display techniques combining scientific and information visualization
methods.</p>
      <p>3.2. Semantics Challenges in Visualization and Visual Analytics</p>
      <p>
        Today users of visualization systems are required to have detailed
knowledge at a technical level about visualization and the data to explore and
analyze. In the future, semantic visualization will put users in the center of
visualization systems. This will be facilitated by using application domain specific
conventions and offering semantic user interfaces as well as interaction techniques
in the application domain instead of the data domain, see e.g. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ], [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>For example, by providing appropriate segmentation methods in
medical visualization, semantic models of the organs will assist surgeons when
planning operations. A possible scenario is that of a medical doctor who directly
specifies that the brain as well as superficial vessels should be displayed in a
combined MR (Magnetic Resonance) and DSA (Digital Subtraction
Angiography) data set, instead of manually specifying volume combination and
transfer functions. Semantic visualization is the most important step towards
making visualization tools a part of the daily routine of domain experts. This
requires the development of appropriate abstractions to provide an immediate
overview as well as additional details and more time consuming interaction
techniques on demand. The possibility to manipulate visualization parameters
on a more technical level will be hidden, but will remain available to expert
users. Therefore, main topics of research on semantics in visualization will be:
− Knowledge-assisted visualization;
− Knowledge-based navigation;
− Integration of semantics with segmentation and feature-detection.</p>
      <p>3.3. Semantics Challenges in Rendering and Virtual Reality</p>
      <p>In rendering, semantics apply in two different ways. Semantics are
important to the user to make correct contextual decisions, a challenge that is
closely coupled to visual analytics. An example could be a railway company
performing laser range scans of railroad tracks. By analyzing these scans and
identifying actual tracks, buildings, vegetation, and other structures, it can query
the enhanced data: e.g. what is the minimal distance between tracks and
buildings along a certain track?</p>
      <p>
        At VRVis [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
        ], researchers have concentrated on flexible framework
designs for procedural multi-resolution representations [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
        ], [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        ]. However,
semantics can also be used as an internal representation within the rendering
system, independent of the rendering methods or usage scenario. As such,
semantics are a highly compressed abstraction of the represented objects, and
capture only the distinguishing features of a specific instance. In an ultimate
semantically based rendering system, it would therefore be possible to specify
each type of object with just those parameters that are necessary to create a
highly realistic, detailed rendering of the object. If an object is an instance of a
group of similar objects only a few parameters may be sufficient to completely
specify the object. As an example for specifying a traffic sign the position,
orientation and type and maybe a few more parameters are sufficient to create a
completely realistic image. This goes further than purely procedural rendering,
since in this case the actual methods (the procedures) are specified separate
from the semantic models. A large part of the know-how of such a semantic
rendering system is encoded in the rules that describe classes of objects.

    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>4. Fusion</title>
      <p>4.1. Challenges in Fusion</p>
      <p>As an example, consider visualization which currently is often only
used to present the results of a technical design process. How can we integrate
visualization into the workflow, so that it can be used to shorten design cycles?
Fusion is a challenge with several interrelated aspects: the fusion of multiple
fields of computer graphics, the fusion of computer graphics with other fields of
computing, and the fusion of multiple data sources.</p>
      <p>Fusing multiple fields of computer graphics is essential for a holistic
analysis of data. In many cases, no single display method is adequate for all
aspects of a complex dataset. For example, simulation results from combustion
processes typically involve geometric data, 3D flow data, and additional
attributes like temperature or vorticity. In another scenario, geographical data
could require realistic real-time rendering of terrains enriched by a visualization
of locally referenced meta-information. To effectively cope with the challenge
of fusing multiple display methods is one of the future research topics.</p>
      <p>In many applications, computer graphics is only used as static
postprocessing or for presenting the results of long and non-interactive
computations (e.g., simulation, data mining, etc.). This may cause significant
delays, as adjustments due to potential errors or improvements require
expensive iterations. It is thus important to strive for human-centric, integrated
approaches, which tightly combine interactive rendering and visualization with
computational methods.</p>
      <p>
        The third kind of fusion concerns the integration of multiple data
sources in the visual analysis of data. Different methods for measuring data
have typically different advantages and disadvantages. It is therefore a
challenge to improve the ultimate result and maximize the gained insight by
simultaneously processing and displaying related data from multiple sources.
This applies to many application domains, among them medical data (e.g.,
computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging), data from scanning
geometry (e.g., photogrammetry, laser scans), and from scanning motion
(e.g., optical tracking, inertial tracking). Another important issue is a unified
analysis of both measured and simulated data, as required for meteorology,
for example [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>4.2. Fusion Challenges in Visualization and Visual Analytics</p>
      <p>
        The overall challenge posed to visualization is increased
significantly by a variety of data sources with widely varying characteristics.
Important examples are different imaging modalities, sensor types, or data
computed in simulations; different representations such as structured or
unstructured grids, point clouds, or geometry; or data of different
dimensionality such as scalar-, vector-, or tensor fields. Moreover, data on
different conceptual levels such as raw, processed or annotated data need to
be integrated effectively. The goal of fusion research in visualization and
visual analytics is to aid in understanding and reasoning about such data
through visual condensation and fusion of the available information.
Coronary artery disease is one example where the fusion of data with vastly
different characteristics can be very helpful. Improvements in magnetic
resonance imaging provide more detailed information on the viability,
functioning, perfusion, and anatomy of a human heart [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ]. As another
example, if flow simulation is directly integrated into a tool for visualizing
and performing combustion-engine design, immediate computation of
pressures and stresses can avoid costly design cycles.
      </p>
      <p>4.3. Fusion Challenges in Rendering and Virtual Reality</p>
      <p>
        Due to the growing heterogeneity of the data involving both spatial and
non-spatial information, it has also become necessary to enrich 3D real-time
rendering with overlays [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
        ], [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ], and to consider spatial semantics in
multivariate visualizations. Besides fusing display methods, a core topic of
visual analytics is to integrate automatic approaches in the process of analyzing
data [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ], [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
        ]. In this context, the ultimate goal is typically more concrete than
just “gaining insight”, and often involves specifying/evaluating/optimizing a
model as knowledge representation [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>
        ],…,[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
        ].

      <title>5. Interaction</title>
      <p>5.1. Challenges in Interaction</p>
      <p>
        An interactive environment, where the user can explore and manipulate
data in real-time in an effective and intuitive way is a powerful tool for many
areas of application. Providing such an environment is a challenge in many
respects, e.g. visualization currently is often only used to present the results of a
technical design process. How can we integrate visualization into the workflow,
so that it can be used to shorten design cycles? Emerging interface technologies
like face, gesture, speech recognition, multi-touch displays, optical tracking,
eye-tracking, even EEG based input, and the proliferation of ubiquitous
systems, bringing computing into the user’s environment, call for innovative
ways of supporting Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Non-classical interface
techniques are already being adopted by the gaming industry: Sony’s EyeToy®
implements gesture-based interaction via a camera, Nintendo’s Wii™
controllers use inertial tracking. Furthermore, systems like the Surface™ [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
        ],
implement non-classical interaction methods like a tangible user interface for
table top settings.
      </p>
      <p>The challenge will be to develop, adapt and evaluate such non-classical
interface techniques as virtual environments, tangible user interfaces or vision
based interaction so that they become effective and meaningful interaction tools
for the respective user, task and device at hand. Depending on the intended
target audience the level of interaction with the environment often needs to be
adapted according to the needs of the user. Balancing user assisted, user
guided/context aware and automatic approaches to achieve the appropriate level
of interaction will be a challenge concerning both the evaluation of the users’
needs and, for many tasks, developing an automatic or guided, context aware
approach on its own. Along with the increasing pervasiveness of distributed
data/systems the focus is shifting from individual users to small and large-scale
interactions for groups of possibly highly mobile users.</p>
      <p>In such multi-user environments, the challenge will be the fusion of
interaction with the environment and the other users to effectively support local
and remote collaboration. As another example consider mobile cell phones that
have GPS, acceleration sensors and cameras. How can we use such devices as
intuitive user interfaces in industrial 3D applications?
5.2. Interaction Challenges in Visualization and Visual Analytics</p>
      <p>Simulations generate terabytes of data. Using appropriate reduction and
filtering methods and the GPU, standard PC hardware can be used to
interactively visualize this huge amount of data and analyze weather phenomena
for improved forecasts.</p>
      <p>
        A successful visualization is not a collection of static images we can
simply browse. A good visualization needs interaction to support the reasoning
process. Interaction plays a major role in most visualization approaches and the
design of efficient interaction is often crucial for the success of a visualization
method. A comprehensive overview of coordinated multiple views, a technique
where interaction plays a crucial role, is described by Roberts in [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>A possible list of interaction research goals is:
− Design of innovative interaction for navigation in complex systems;
− Clever combination of various visualization techniques;
− Intuitive switching between levels while keeping a system overview;
− Setup of interactive collaborative visualization systems;
− Interaction scenarios for on-line collaborative interaction;
− Research interaction scenarios for off-line collaborative analysis;
− Explore interaction for mixed groups of experts and non-expert users.</p>
      <p>5.3. Interaction Challenges in Rendering and Virtual Reality</p>
      <p>In rendering and virtual reality, the interaction challenge appears mainly
in the context of human-computer interaction, i.e. the challenge of finding suitable
input and display devices for a given application, and in collaborative interaction
of multiple simultaneous users. In all rendering applications that are targeted at
real-time or interactive usage scenarios, proper choice of interaction and display
devices naturally plays an important role. The ideal interaction metaphor may vary
widely with the actual application, and may range from traditional keyboard and
mouse to more complex devices such as the SpaceMouse (a desktop device that
allows navigation and manipulation with 6 degrees of freedom, although with
limited range) and VR interfaces. In addition to the input devices to be used, this
challenge also includes the design and placement of user interface elements within
a given application, a non-trivial issue.</p>
      <p>
        For example, a virtual simulation of a fire on a projector can be
combined with a mock fire extinguisher for emergency training. By using the
fire extinguisher as a user-interface to the simulation, a highly realistic training
scenario can be provided [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
        ].

      <title>6. Acquisition</title>
      <p>6.1. Challenges in Acquisition</p>
      <p>
        Today Visual Computing focuses on the display and analysis of real
world data gathered by an array of diverse measurement techniques. While former
rendering methods concentrated on simulating complexity by using textures,
approximated illumination, and simplified modeling of complex structures,
nowadays we face the challenge of visualizing data gathered by data acquisition
systems. Currently, effective and successful information extraction methods are
mostly multi-stage solutions, applying several highly specialized methods
integrating domain expert knowledge into a complex segmentation chain [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>While manually modelled data normally lacks detail and internal
consistency – for example, due to non-manifolds and widely varying levels of
detail – acquired data typically suffer from measurement errors, noise, dropouts,
repetition, and lack of semantic information. Typical acquisition areas include:
architectural data such as digitized elevation plans, laser scans,
photogrammetric data (images &amp; models); medical &amp; industrial data such as
computer tomography, magnetic resonance images, X-ray, ultrasound; real-time
acquisition of position and geometry from depth images (from photogrammetric
data or phase cameras), GPS, GSM triangulation, computer vision methods
(optical flow, pattern recognition) and finally meteorological data such as
satellite images, radar, lidar, temperature, humidity, and pressure measurements.
All of these examples describe the same physical phenomena by measuring
them with different methods and instruments.</p>
      <p>The downside of acquired data is that we cannot trust it to be consistent,
precise, or even complete, the upside is that by using multiple instruments we
gather in most cases redundant information about the same phenomenon. This
results in the following challenges: generate consistent and unambiguous
models from hybrid measurement data. This includes the statistically or
empirically valid interpolation of gaps in the measurement, and correcting
known artifacts of the applied measurement technologies; reduce data volume
and create representations for the next processing step in the workflow (e.g.
semantic analysis and/or rendering).</p>
      <p>
        Examples for this challenge are the recreation of surface or volume data
from point samples, and the reduction of geometric detail to a more compact
representation like templates or texture/displacement maps; and the application
of real-time techniques to reduce error and lag in hybrid acquisition techniques,
e.g. use inertial sensors for prediction of movement or phase-cameras to fill
holes and resolve ambiguity in photogrammetric techniques. Similar techniques
can be used to combine fast, low-resolution sensors with slow, high resolving
ones to approximate continuous high-resolution data streams. The books [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>
        ]
and [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>
        ] give excellent overviews on established techniques for image
processing and analysis.

      <p>6.2. Acquisition Challenges in Visualization and Visual Analytics</p>
      <p>Acquisition in the context of visualization refers mainly to techniques
that derive information from raw data to generate high quality, high
performance, meaningful, and user-friendly visualizations. This includes data
enhancement methods like denoising and filtering, compression, hierarchical or
topological re-organization of the data, feature extraction and classification
methods, segmentation of structures of interest, and automatic derivation of
high level information on the basis of previously generated segmentations.
There is a direct relationship of acquisition in this context to the challenges
semantics and fusion. Both require additional derived information from raw
data – semantics is often related to features and objects present in the data. Such
objects have to be detected and classified to provide the basis for a semantically
defined visualization. Fusion needs a description of correspondence between
individual datasets to be able to relate different representations of the same
object across multi-source and multi-level data. Acquisition is a necessary
preprocessing step for both challenges.</p>
      <p>
        In medical visualization, different 3D scanning techniques (e.g. MRI,
CT) excel at measuring different medical properties. The goal is to combine the
differently acquired data to improve accuracy and reduce noise [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>
        ]. And
industrial CT scans of heterogeneous materials suffer from artifacts due to
varying physical properties of the components. By better addressing these
problems, highly accurate measurements on the data will be possible.
      </p>
      <p>6.3. Acquisition Challenges in Rendering and Virtual Reality</p>
      <p>All measured data contains errors and artifacts. To generate consistent
representations of real-world objects for visualization, documentation, or
simulation purposes, methods have to be invented and improved to reduce these
errors to an acceptable minimum. What kind of error counts as ‘acceptable’ of
course depends on the requirements of the following algorithms and steps in the
workflow. While visualization techniques may not require a topologically
consistent representation of an object, some simulation algorithms will not work
with ambiguous or non-manifold geometry. While this has been true even for
manually modeled objects, it is especially problematic to reconstruct consistent
representations from huge data sets acquired with laser scanners and other
acquisition systems.</p>
      <p>Systematic errors introduced by these instruments have to be handled
on a consistent basis: one has to identify critical data at the earliest possible
stage in the workflow, before erroneous data is merged into other, possibly
correct data sets. There are multiple possible error sources that have to be
handled. Random sampling noise can be reduced by over-sampling in time or
space, thereby gathering more samples which can be smoothed using statistical
tools. Systematic error can be reduced using redundant information, possibly
from other modalities, or by previous gathered calibration data. An example for
such an approach is reconstructive filtering to reduce artifacts at significant
features. Aliasing, i.e. under-sampling in the time- or spatial domain without
low-pass filters, can produce artifacts which – according to the sampling
theorem – cannot be removed using the measured data alone. Here additional
data acquisition is necessary.</p>
      <p>
        A special challenge is the acquisition of highly structured surfaces, such
as old buildings like churches, for archival or heritage purposes. Automatically
scanned images of such structures are normally plagued by gaps and
contradictions. Systematic handling of such data helps to reconstruct and
correctly document the true geometry of such surfaces, e.g. [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>
        ].

      <title>7. Conclusions</title>
      <p>Computer Graphics as a computer science discipline was able to solve
many issues formulated in the past faster than expected and further than
expected. For many practical applications, however, the need for more and
better visual user interfaces is ever growing and new challenges have to be
tackled in order to make computer graphics techniques useful. These challenges
are the coping with large data sets and complex hardware, the inclusion of
semantics into all modeling data, the fusion of multiple techniques to solve
complex problems, new and better interaction paradigms, and methods to
acquire all the data needed in complex environments. This paper has described
in detail many of these challenges and brought many examples where these
challenges play a significant role. Computer Graphics is not solved, but it is
entering a new epoch of a little less purely graphical problems. Together with
neighboring disciplines it now forms the area of Visual Computing, and it is the
hope that most of these challenges can be solved within the coming decades.</p>

      <p>(Rezumat)
În ultimele trei decenii, grafica pe calculator a fost una dintre direcţiile de
succes din domeniul ştiinţei calculatoarelor iar metodele şi rezultatele de care dispunem
în prezent au depăşit aşteptările. Prin urmare, problemele legate de procesarea grafică se
consideră a fi rezolvate, având în vedere că există suficiente medii şi unelte pentru
dezvoltarea aplicaţiilor specifice. Dar acest fapt este adevărat doar pentru aplicaţii
simple vizând prelucrarea imaginilor. Integrarea tehnologiilor de prelucrare grafică în
aplicaţii din ce în ce mai complexe aduce noi provocări.</p>
      <p>Procesarea grafica se regăseşte în aplicaţii complexe interdisciplinare şi acest
fapt determină dezvoltarea concomitentă a tehnologiilor implicate. Printre aceste
domenii se regăsesc: computer vision, procesarea de imagini, recunoaşterea formelor,
urmărirea traiectoriilor, scanarea, augmentarea video, teoria informaţiei, proiectarea
interfeţelor utilizator, baze de date de mari dimensiuni etc.</p>
      <p>În această lucrare este prezentată o imagine generală a tendinţelor de cercetare
pentru urmărorii ani, acordând o atenţie deosebită unor provocări cu un rol semnificativ
în toate subdomeniile graficii pe calculator: scalabilitate, semantică, fuziune, interacţiune
şi achiziţie. Deşi nu toate aceste probleme sunt reciproc disjuncte, această prezentare ne
permite să avem o privire de ansamblu asupra provocărilor concrete viitoare.</p>
      <p>Cercetarea în direcţia procesării grafice intră într-o nouă epocă, formând
împreună cu alte direcţii complementare domeniul Visual Computing.</p>
