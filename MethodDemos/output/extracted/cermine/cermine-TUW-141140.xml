      <abstract>
        <p>Current model-driven Web Engineering approaches (such as OO-H, UWE or WebML) provide a set of methods and supporting tools for a systematic design and development of Web applications. Each method addresses different concerns using separate models (content, navigation, presentation, business logic, etc.), and provide model compilers that produce most of the logic and Web pages of the application from these models. However, these proposals also have some limitations, especially for exchanging models or representing further modeling concerns, such as architectural styles, technology independence, or distribution. A possible solution to these issues is provided by making model-driven Web Engineering proposals interoperate, being able to complement each other, and to exchange models between the different tools. MDWEnet is a recent initiative started by a small group of researchers working on model-driven Web Engineering (MDWE). Its goal is to improve current practices and tools for the model-driven development of Web applications for better interoperability. The proposal is based on the strengths of current modeldriven Web Engineering methods, and the existing experience and knowledge in the field. This paper presents the background, motivation, scope, and objectives of MDWEnet. Furthermore, it reports on the MDWEnet results and achievements so far, and its future plan of actions.</p>

      <p>Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) advocates the use of models and model
transformations as the key features in all phases of software development, from system
specification and analysis over design to implementation and testing. Each model usually
addresses one concern, independently of the rest of the issues involved in the
construction of the system. Thus, the basic functionality of the system can be separated
from its final implementation; the business logic can be separated from the underlying
platform technology, etc. The transformations between models enable the automated
implementation of a system right from the different models defined for it.</p>
      <p>
        Web Engineering is a specific domain in which model-driven software
development can be successfully applied [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ]. Existing model-driven Web Engineering
approaches (such as OO-H [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ], UWE [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ] or WebML [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ]) already provide a set of
suitable methods and tools for the design and development of most kinds of Web
applications. They address different concerns using separate models (navigation,
presentation, business logic, etc.) and come with model compilers that produce most of the
application’s Web pages and logic based on these models. However, most of these
Web Engineering proposals do not fully exploit all the potential benefits of MDE,
such as complete platform independence, or tool interoperability. In addition, these
proposals also have some limitations, especially when it comes to exchanging models
or expressing further concerns, such as architectural styles or distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, the OMG’s Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) initiative [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ] has
introduced a new approach for organizing the design of an application into different
models so portability, interoperability and reusability can be obtained through
architectural separation of concerns. MDA covers a wide spectrum of topics and issues
ranging from MOF-based metamodels to UML profiles, model transformations and
modeling languages.
      </p>
      <p>However, the effective integration with the already existing model-driven Web
Engineering approaches has been only partially achieved. The most interesting issue
is the interoperability of models and artifacts designed using the different existing
development methods to enable the use of synergies. The vision is, at the end of a
long way, to count on either one unified method based on the strengths of the
different methods, or interoperability bridges (transformations) between the individual
models and tools that would allow their seamless integration for building Web
applications.</p>
      <p>Many groups of the Web Engineering community share these objectives. Lively
discussions took place at both Model-Driven Web Engineering (MDWE) workshops
in Sydney (2005) and Menlo Park (2006). A small number of groups decided to
reinforce discussions on workshops with a set of planned activities in order to get
concrete solutions to the current problem of interoperability of model-driven Web
Engineering approaches. The initiative is called MDWEnet and started its activities in
December 2006. This paper provides an overview of the motivation and background
of this initiative (Section 2), its scope and objectives (Section 3), activities (Section
4), and future plans (Section 5).

      <title>Background and Motivation</title>
      <p>The growing interest in Model-Driven Web Engineering has produced quite a
significant number of results, which have materialized into a concrete set of MDWE
approaches. As mentioned above, they provide suitable methods and tools for the design
and development of Web applications, but they also present some limitations. So far,
each group is mainly working on progressively improving their own proposals in an
independent manner, with the exception of a couple of bilateral collaborations. One
alternative solution is provided by the possibility of making Web proposals
interoperate, being able to complement each other, and to exchange models between the
different tools. This is precisely one of the goals of MDWEnet.</p>
      <p>
        The authors of this paper met for the first time in Munich in December 2006, with
the objective of coordinating the current efforts being carried out by individual groups
in the field of MDWE. They are members from five of the groups that work on these
topics, including the UWE, OO-H and WebML teams from the Universities of
Munich, Alicante and Politecnico di Milano, respectively. The other two groups are from
the University of Malaga, and from a joint cooperation between the Technical
University of Vienna and the Johannes Kepler University of Linz, contributing with their
knowledge on frameworks, metamodels and model transformations in the Web field
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6 ref7 ref8">6,7,8</xref>
        ]. The intention is to harmonize their efforts in order to be more effective, to
avoid duplicated work, and to align their targets and goals. The plan was to start with
a small number of groups first, and then to open to the rest of the MDWE community
as soon as the first results were tangible and could be shown.
      </p>
      <p>Several discussions took place during the meeting, most of them being
representative examples of the topics and issues of current interest to the MDWE community.
First, the current activities and work in progress of each group were presented. Then,
a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis of the situation
of MDWE in the fields of MDE and Web Engineering was conducted, to provide a
clear picture of the context and the current position from where to start. The following
sections describe these issues, because they not only can be of help to the MDWEnet
group, but can also be of interest to the whole MDWE community.

      <title>Scope and objectives of MDWEnet</title>
      <p>The scope of the MDWEnet initiative is the model-driven development of Web
applications, using different methods and tools, while ensuring the interoperability of their
artifacts and models.</p>
      <p>The overall objective is to improve current practices and tools for the
modeldriven development of Web applications, by making use of the strengths of current
model-driven Web Engineering methods, and the existing experience and knowledge
in the field.</p>
      <p>The way in which we decided to reach this goal is by investigating the
interoperability of model-driven Web Engineering methods, i.e., by trying to explore how Web
proposals could interoperate, be able to complement each other, and exchange models
between the different tools.</p>
      <p>Two clear phases in the process were distinguished: (1) proof of concept and
validation; and (2) application of the interoperability approach.</p>
      <p>
        The first phase is focused on investigating how this interoperability can be
achieved at a basic level (i.e., over the fundamental set of elements and functionality
that any MDWE method should cover), and on its validation for three MDWE
methods: OO-H [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ], UWE [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ] and WebML [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ]. This phase is based on an incremental and
iterative process, starting from a very small set of features and functionality that the
different methods should deal with, which are progressively extended until the basic
functionality offered by any MDWE approach is covered.
      </p>
      <p>Once we achieve the required interoperability between the individual methods at
that basic level, the second phase will use a set of representative Web applications to
progressively extend these modeling elements and features, being able to deal with
both static and dynamic aspects of Web application design.

    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>Activities</title>
      <p>During the workshop different possibilities to achieve the objectives were discussed,
as already mentioned, focusing on two options: to use or not to use a common
metamodel. In order to be able to define precise actions, the MDWEnet group had to
make a set of decisions related to the technologies and tools to be used for
implementing the actions. Some of these decisions were not easy to make, as described below. A
plan of concrete actions was defined, relying on a strong commitment of the teams of
all groups.
4.1</p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>Possibilities</title>
        <p>In general, there are many ways to achieve these goals, especially in the MDE field—
which is neither fully mature nor well established yet. For instance, we had the
following choices for tackling the problem of the interoperability between different
MDWE approaches.</p>
        <p>•
•
•</p>
        <p>Taking the best of each approach and try to define an integrated approach (in
a similar way in which the UML was originally defined)?
Developing a common metamodel?
Preserving the nature of each web method and try to concentrate the efforts
to process transformations between models?</p>
        <p>We decided to initially explore two possibilities, and, once we have some concrete
results, to look back and decide based on the pros and cons of each one. These
possibilities, together with their advantages and disadvantages (a priori) are as follows.</p>
        <p>Option 1: Definition of a metamodel for each individual approach and of the
transformations between the different metamodels.</p>
        <sec id="sec-4-1-1">
          <title>Assumptions</title>
          <p>– There exists no common metamodel, or
– No agreement is reached w.r.t. a common metamodel, or
– The common metamodel is not expressive enough, or
– Transformations are possible between all individual metamodels
Benefits/advantages
– Individuality is respected
– Tools are readily available
– Zoos (model repositories) can be “easily” built and maintained to
share models
Disadvantages
– Integration and interoperation are much more difficult
– Sharing tools is complicated
– Too many transformations required [n(n–1)]
Option 2: Definition of a common metamodel
• Assumptions
– There exists a common metamodel
– An agreement is reached w.r.t. such a common metamodel
– The common metamodel is expressive enough
– Transformations are possible to/from all individual metamodels
• Benefits/advantages
– Integration and interoperation are easier
– Sharing tools is possible
– Core competencies (presentation/information/tools/…)
– Less transformations between metamodels [2n]
• Disadvantages
– Individuality is somehow lost
– Too many assumptions
– Interoperability conflicts between different proposals</p>
          <p>Of course, none of these options is free from problems. For example, should the
common metamodel be (a) just the basics of MDWE; (b) the intersection of the
metamodels of all MDWE proposals; or (c) the union of all metamodels?</p>
          <p>Regarding the notation to express the metamodels, should we use MOF, eMOF,
Ecore, KM3, or other metamodeling languages?</p>
          <p>This leads to a more delicate question, regarding the MDE approach to use. Should
we go try to be compatible with the OMG approach (which means using MOF, UML,
QVT, etc), the Microsoft approach, or other (e.g., use AMMA and the ATLAS way)?</p>
          <p>This has also to do with the choice of the modeling tools, since they do not
interoperate at present. This is another important decision, since the only way to be able to
seamlessly exchange models and artefacts is by sharing a common modeling tool
(such as Enterprise Architect, MagicDraw, etc.). And the same is true for the model
transformation language and tool to use: QVT (Together), graph-based (AGG,
VIATRA, ATOM3), or other (e.g., ATL).
4.2</p>
        </sec>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-2">
        <title>Decisions</title>
        <p>As aforementioned, we decided to explore the two options above: (1) to define and
use individual metamodels and transformations between them; and (2) to define a
common metamodel and transformations to/from the metamodels of the different
proposals. The common metamodel will be defined as the union of all metamodels.
The metamodeling language will be Ecore, and the MDE approach will be based on
the ATLAS group initiative, i.e., using the ATL as model transformation language.
For drawing models we agreed to use MagicDraw as modeling tool.
4.3</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-3">
        <title>Plan of actions</title>
        <p>Based on these decisions, a concrete plan of actions was set up. It was organized into
two phases, the first one running for 6 months. The actions to be developed during the
first phase focus on the definition of a common metamodel, on the specification of the
metamodels of the three initial proposals (UWE, OO-H and WebML) and on the
transformations between these metamodels.</p>
        <p>In addition, the actions should achieve the preparation of a survey of existing
MDWE approaches and a “map” of communities that work on topics closely related
to Model-Driven Web Engineering. A second phase would build on the result of the
first one, and would consist of the definition of a Web Engineering modeling
ontology, the evaluation of existing Web Engineering modeling tool environments and
their capabilities for integration. Another goal is to cooperate in teaching and
research, e.g., sharing teaching material and the acquisition of funding for joint projects.

      <sec id="sec-4-4">
        <title>Results so far</title>
        <p>Although there is still a long way to go, we already count on a set of results, which
could be of interest to the MDWE community.</p>
        <p>The first one is a Wiki web, used by the group as a collaborative platform. The
Wiki allows the exchange of information, documents, models, and tools, as well as
the development of joint work on the material. It fulfills also the role of a repository
of all kind of interesting information on model-driven Web Engineering topics.</p>
        <p>The Wiki also contains the results that the actions have produced. In particular, it
includes a collection of information on funding opportunities, the specification of the
common metamodel, core metamodels of OO-H, UWE and WebML and a set of
example model problems.

      <p>The current activities are limited to the proof of concept of a first approach of
interoperability of three methods OO-H, UWE and WebML. We also restricted the number
of issues the different methods should manage to a small set of basic features of Web
applications.</p>
      <p>We plan to extend the current state with further modeling elements of the selected
methods in order to cover all static and dynamic model-driven aspects of Web
applications. Further methods and experimental material for volunteers to conduct
experiments on external quality of Web applications developed with Web Engineering
methods will be provided as well. At a long term plan the vision of a fully integrated
environment where modeling and generation of Web applications using any method
would be possible.</p>
