      <abstract>
        <p>The aim of the ECIC project is the dissemination of participative methods of organizational development originating from Scandinavian countries to other European countries. To support this process we developed a hypertextual learning system. Because of the heterogeneous target group and the illstructured domains of ECIC detailed usability testing is necessary. First tentative results indicate that graphical overview maps play an important role and interactive examples are very motivating.</p>

      <p>aloud protocols are a fairly disruptive form of investigation. Nevertheless, we find that this method
conveys information, which cannot be obtained otherwise, like, e.g. learners' motivation for using or not
using specific links or graphical overview maps. In order to interpret correctly if a user stays at the same
topic during a long time, it is important to know whether the user finds the topic very interesting or very
confusing.</p>
      <p>
        We also developed a monitoring tool to log the users' actions. This tool creates a log-file with information
about the duration of a session, the exact time when a page is accessed or left and the object, which is
used to leave a page.
From these data we can infer whether users traverse the document hierarchically or in a sequential way
and whether they visited the graphical overviews or maps to a large extent. The monitoring tool also
provides information about how long users visit a specific node. Based on this information, a directed
graph can be constructed showing the moves of the user (Fig. 1). McEneaney uses similar graphs to
visualize users' behavior [

        ].
      </p>
      <p>If analysis of users' behavior is only based on navigational log-files, wrong conclusions could be drawn.
Both methods – thinking aloud protocols and software logging – are supposed to complement one
another to give a more comprehensive view of learners' behavior.</p>

      <title>RESULTS</title>
      <p>So far, we have tested two persons who worked with the ECIC learning system. Those tests were very
extensive and yielded a large amount of data. During the test we also investigated whether the test
procedure we developed was viable or not. We realized, for example, that asking the users too many
questions during the test was rather disruptive. One (tentative) result of our evaluation is that the
graphical overviews played an important role for the subjects, although one of the two persons also
employed a sequential mode of browsing to a large extent. For both subjects, it was difficult at first to
adapt to the hypertextual form of organization of information. As expected, users spend very much time
examining pages with complex information. But Interactive examples engage users' attention even when
they do not convey very much information. One user mentioned that some of the interactive examples in
the learning system gave him a more vivid impression of the method described. After the test we asked
the users to write down the most salient information they kept in mind. One of the subjects drew a
graphical map resembling the overview map in the program. The same person used the graphical
overview map of the ECIC learning system very frequently.</p>

      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>The evaluation of the ECIC learning system is an ongoing process. So far, we have data from two
subjects. These data indicate that graphical overviews or maps probably play an important role for
learner navigation. We intend to investigate several more subjects to get more representative results.
Furthermore, we want to develop a more systematic method of analysis for the thinking aloud protocols
and for the directed graphs representing the learners' paths through the document.</p>
