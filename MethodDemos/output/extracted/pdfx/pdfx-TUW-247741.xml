      <abstract class="DoCO:Abstract" id="3">Evaluating the quality of segmentations is an important process in image processing, especially in the medical domain. Many evaluation metrics have been used in evaluating segmentation. There exists no formal way to choose the most suitable metric(s) for a particular segmentation task and/or particular data. In this paper we propose a formal method for choosing the most suitable metrics for evaluating the quality of segmentations with respect to ground truth segmentations. The proposed method depends on measuring the bias of metrics towards/against the properties of the the segmentations being evaluated. We firstly demonstrate how metrics can have bias towards/against particular properties and then we propose a general method for ranking metrics according to their overall bias. We finally demonstrate for 3D medical image segmentations that ranking produced using metrics with low overall bias strongly correlate with manual rankings done by an expert.

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="30" page="1" column="1">1.1 The need to understand metrics: Many evaluation metrics for image segmentation have been introduced; most researchers choose the evaluation metrics arbitrar- ily or according to their popularity. Investigating metrics would help researchers to better understand them and help companies and stakeholders to save effort and time reaching optimal systems [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="5" class="deo:Reference">1</xref>]. A poorly defined metric may lead to inaccurate conclusions like selecting suboptimal models when comparing the performance of classifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="6" class="deo:Reference">2</xref>]. Many researchers have investigated the drawbacks of particular metrics given particular properties of the data being classified. As a special case of classification, image segmentation is also affected by these drawbacks. The following are some examples: Hausdorff distance is very sensitive to noise and least squares<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> based evaluation methods are very sensitive to outliers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="9" class="deo:Reference">3</xref>]. Mutual information doesn’t utilize spatial information inherited in images because only voxel relationships are considered but not the neighbor- hoods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="10" class="deo:Reference">4</xref>]. Information theoretical measures have a non-convergent baseline which depends on the ratio between the number of data points and the number of classes. Therefore this class of measure needs chance correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="11" class="deo:Reference">5</xref>]. Commonly used measures (precision, recall and F-measures) are biased and don’t consider the level of chance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="12" class="deo:Reference">6</xref>]. Choosing evaluation metrics is very important and application-dependent; when evaluating imbalanced datasets, the metric choice is not obvious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="13" class="deo:Reference">2</xref>]. Metrics have different properties with respect to their correlation with user satisfaction criteria and their ease of interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="14" class="deo:Reference">7</xref>]. Benhabiles et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="15" class="deo:Reference">8</xref>] validated 250 automatic segmentations against their corresponding ground truth segmentations using four different evaluation metrics. The results were then compared with manual ratings from 40 human ob- servers. They found that the correlations between the ranking based on the manual ratings and the rankings based on the evaluation metrics vary between 30% and 80% depending on the used metric. Research in the last decades generally results in the relative system improvement achieved becoming smaller and smaller. As a result, sensitivity and fidelity of evaluation metrics become increasingly criti- cal. When improvements are small, metrics with high sensitivity are needed to measure small but real improvements and also with high fidelity to distinguish between improvements based on user preferences and improvements resulting from biased relevance judg- ments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="16" class="deo:Reference">9</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="17" class="deo:Reference">10</xref>].<marker type="block"/> 1.2 Problem definition and notations: In this paper, we propose a formal method for selecting the most suitable metrics to evaluate image segmentation depending on the data being segmented and the goal of the segmentation task. The method is primarily based on two facts: the first is that effectiveness metrics can be biased towards or against properties of the images being segmented, meaning that particular metrics over-<marker type="page" number="2"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> penalize or over-reward segmentations given particular properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="23" class="deo:Reference">4</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="24" class="deo:Reference">6</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="25" class="deo:Reference">11</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="26" class="deo:Reference">2</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="27" class="deo:Reference">3</xref>]. The second fact is that selecting the best evaluation metrics can be sub- ject to the segmentation goal which means that the bias towards/against a particular property of the data can be differently important depending on the segmentation goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="28" class="deo:Reference">8</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="29" class="deo:Reference">7</xref>]. To meet the context dependency, the proposed method allows individual weighting of the influence of each property according to its importance in case this is known, which increases the effectiveness of the method. The problem to be solved in this paper can be formulated as follows: given a set of metrics M = { M 1 , M 2, ..., M r } , a set of image segmentations C = { C 1 , C 2 , ...., C k } , then the task is to rank the metrics in M according to their suitability for evaluating the quality of the segmentations in C provided that for each segmentation there exists a ground truth segmentation. The proposed method is general and can be applied to select evaluation metrics for all types of segmentations. However, for simplicity, we will consider only the crisp segmentation task in this paper to present and for- mulate the method. In particular, we will be analyzing and testing the method using a special type of segmentation, namely medical volume segmentation e.g. mag- netic resonance images (MRI) where voxels (3D pixels) are either assigned or not to a given class (segment) e.g. an organ or a tumor.</region>

[ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="32" class="deo:Reference">12</xref>] established a formal method for comparing two different measures and introduced two criteria for formal comparison of the goodness of evaluation metrics, namely the degree of consistency (DoC) and degree of discriminancy (DoD). Applying these criteria, they showed theoretically and empirically that AUC is a better measure than accuracy in evaluating the performance of classifiers. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="33" class="deo:Reference">13</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="34" class="deo:Reference">14</xref>] applied formal constraints based on axiometry to compare and judge evaluation metrics depending on the grade of satisfaction of these constraints. Busin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="35" class="deo:Reference">15</xref>] used axiometrics to define a formal and general notation that fits any effectiveness metric. Based on this notation, they proposed several axioms that should be satisfied by an effectiveness metric. They used these axioms as criteria to evaluate metrics. All these papers deal with the problem only from a theoretical axiometrical point of view without taking into account the classification goal and the nature and properties of data being classified. Sakai [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="36" class="deo:Reference">11</xref>] proposed a method for evaluating evaluation metrics by measuring their sensitivity using Boot- strap Hypothesis Tests, and used this method in com-<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> paring seven evaluation metrics. They negate the belief that commonly used evaluation measures are equally reliable. Fatourechi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="38" class="deo:Reference">2</xref>] proposed a framework based on Desired Region of Operation (DROP) for selecting the best evaluation metric for evaluating imbalanced classifications. Sakai [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="39" class="deo:Reference">16</xref>] provided comparisons between metrics depending on the sensitivity and sta- bility using the Voorhees/Buckley swap method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="40" class="deo:Reference">17</xref>].

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="43" page="2" column="2">We propose a method for choosing the most suitable metric for evaluating image segmentation. In Sections 3.1 to 3.3, the method is described and discussed formally. Then this formal description is explained in a step by step demonstration with a real example in Section 4, which also provides an experimental evaluation of the method. Given a set of effectiveness metrics M and a set of segmentations C , each of the segmentations is evaluated against its ground truth segmentation using all metrics to obtain a ranking per metric. Now, choosing the most suitable metric goes in two main steps: (i) Constructing different partitions on the segmentation set C and ranking the subsets of each partition according to their average quality regarding each metric. (ii) Inferring the metric bias from the rank correlations across all partitions and all metrics. In the following, each of the steps is described in more details.</region>

Define a set F of t segmentation properties. These can be any features thought to impact metrics e.g. class imbalance, number of segments, segment size, noise, deviation, shape signatures, sphereness, boundary smoothness, resolution, moments, etc. Furthermore, features can also be score-dependent e.g. precision and recall for utilizing trade-off i.e. for evaluation that tends to reward precision on cost of recall and vice versa.

Case 2, partitioning the segmentations according to a particular property (e.g. class imbalance in the underlying segmentations). Given a particular metric m , the base correlation K ˇ ( m ) given by Equation 4 (related to Case 1) depends on the nature of the metric and is not affected by the properties of the segmentations, since the partition is random. Now, if this correlation changes when we consider Case 2 (i.e. biased correlation K given by Equation 5), then the change is caused by the impact of the property used for partitioning (in this case class imbalance) on the metric and therefore it characterizes the bias of the metric towards/against this property. If many partitions (many properties) are used, then the sum of the correlation differences is a measure of the overall bias for the given metric.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="80" page="3" column="2">In this section, the proposed method is demonstrated and tested with a real example, namely a set of 229 automatic brain tumor segmentations (MRI 3D volumes) from the BRATS2012 challenge 1 . The segmentations correspond to 47 medical cases and were produced by 1 MICCAI 2012 Challenge on Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmenta- tion, www2.imm.dtu.dk/projects/BRATS2012 <marker type="page" number="4"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> five different algorithms participating in BRATS challenge. To build the rank structure (described in Section 3.1), all segmentations were evaluated against their ground truth segmentations using 18 metrics (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" id="77" class="deo:Reference">Table 1</xref>) to get the score matrix s (Step 1). Then global ranks were calculated from scores to get a ranking per metric r (Step 2). A set of 7 properties, namely segment size, noise, class imbalance, connected compo- nent count, point variance, sphereness, and recall, was defined (Step 3). Now, 7 partitions of the segmentations were constructed each time using one of the defined properties. Each consists of 10 subsets with 229 10 ≈ 22 segmentations (Step 4). A random partition with 10 equal subsets was constructed (Step 5). For each partition, the subsets were ranked using the sum of individual global ranks r to get 18 rankings per partition (126 rankings in total). The random partition was also ranked to get 18 rankings (Step 6). To infer metric bias, Equations 4, 5, and 6 in Section 3.2 were applied to the resulting rank structure. The result of this step is a metric list ranked according to bias. To validate the suitability ranking produced by the proposed approach, a manual ranking done by a ra- diology expert was used: for each medical case, the five corresponding segmentations were ranked by their quality from a medical point of view (we call these the manual rankings). Analogously, for each medical case, 18 rankings of the five segmentations were produced each time using one of metrics (we call these the metric rankings). The average correlation between manual rankings and metric rankings was computed for each metric and finally the metrics were sorted according to this average correlation. The resulting metric ranking (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" id="78" class="deo:Reference">Table 1</xref> column ’manual’) was used as a ground truth suitability ranking of the metrics to validate the automatic ranking. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" id="79" class="deo:Reference">Table 1</xref> column ’automatic’ contains for each metric the bias (Equation 6) and the corresponding suitability rank computed according to ascending bias. A moderate to strong correlation between the two rankings can be observed. The six best metrics are the same in both rankings. This correlation shows that metrics with low bias produce rankings that are more corre- lated to manual rankings than others.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="87" page="4" column="1">For evaluating segmentations, metrics can be chosen according to their bias (Equation 6) toward/against the properties of the segmentations being evaluated. Test results show that the ranking produced by metrics with low bias generally have higher correlation with manual ranking than rankings produced by other metrics. In future work, the method will be tested with seg- <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> mentations of other types and validated against rankings from different experts. A further issue to be investigated in future work is the influence of weighting the properties in Equation 6 on the metric suitability ranking, if it is known that particular properties are more/less important for the segmentation goal. For example, the manual ranking used to validate this method is done by a radiologist who may emphasise recall on cost of precision to assure that the tumor is completely removed. In this case weighting the recall and precision properly could improve the result.</region>
