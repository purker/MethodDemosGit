      <abstract class="DoCO:Abstract" id="9">— Cloud computing is introducing the next big shift IT-industry. It fundamentally changes the IT-strategy of organizations. Cloud computing promises many advantages such reduced capital expense, support of brief surges in capacity and economies of scale [1]. Cloud computing is not only a technology for the private sector rather it also can benefit sector in many ways [2]. It makes e-government systems cheaper and accelerates the adaptation of use of IT by [3]. Cloud computing is high on the agenda of Obama administration and is being used by federal and local governments significant benefits [4]. In the European Union the potentials Cloud computing have been recognized and the Cloud being pushed forward, not only because of its cost saving but also because of its impact on the environment. work we have conducted a case study for integration of computing in the Austrian Public sector. The contribution of is identification of the requirements of the public sector obstacles for integration of cloud computing in the Austrian sector. In this case study eight ministries and the office of chancellor have been interviewed. important requirements of the Austrian public sector can summarized as follows: In conclusion, security and privacy is the biggest challenge for the integration of Cloud computing in the Austrian public sector. A possible solution would be a cloud run by the European Commission itself that hosts applications of the member states.</abstract>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="22" page="1" column="1">Legal compliance: The most important factor for the public sector is legal compliance. E.g. the Austrian and European laws require that data remain within the borders of the European Union. Reliability: The public sector policies are long-term. It must be ensured that any Cloud solution and provider exists in the coming 10-20 years. Availability: The Austrian public sector requires that its services be available at least from 7 AM to 7 PM MET. In case of the Austrian ministry of foreign affairs from 7 AM to 7 PM local time. Compatibility and connectivity: Any Cloud solution must be compatible with already available in-house solutions. Each ministry runs its own in-house servers. Scalability: Services must be scalable enough such that citizens can also be served in peak times. <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> Network security: Ministries and organizations within the Austrian public sector are connected through Corporate Network Austria (CAN). Within this trusted network authentication and data transport security is not a major concern. Cloud computing poses a fundamentally new challenge as Internet cannot be regarded as a trusted network. Lack of knowledge about available systems: Each department runs its own applications. Many concurrent technologies and operating systems run in parallel. Acquiring knowledge about the current state and used technologies is a tedious task. Previous investments: The public sector has invested heavily in IT-infrastructure. Migration of available solutions onto cloud makes previous investments unneeded. Business continuity: Because of lack of interoperability between cloud providers, moving between cloud providers is almost impossible. IT-strategist in the public sector state the concern what if a cloud provider goes out of business and it is impossible to move to another cloud provider.</region>
