  <title>Extensions for Interaction Nets</title>
  <abstractText>â€” Interaction Nets are a novel model of computation based on graph rewriting. Their main properties are parallel evaluation and sharing of computation, which leads to ef- ficient programs. However, Interaction Nets lack several features that allow for their convenient use as a programming language. In this paper, we describe the implementation of an extension for pattern matching of interaction rules. Furthermore, we show the correctness of the implementation and discuss its complexity.</abstractText>
