               <p>â€” One indispensable precondition for designing a functional software product for the modeling and execution of a computerized clinical practice guideline (CPG) is the comprehensive investigation of the different user groups involved and the issues they encounter. This led us to conduct a comprehensive literature study about the tasks involved in modeling a CPG into a formal representation as well as about the information needs of caregivers, i.e., physicians and nurses, and last but not least the information needs of patients. We have assessed and categorized the above mentioned information in order to create a reliable starting point for the development of a functional software tool.</p>
