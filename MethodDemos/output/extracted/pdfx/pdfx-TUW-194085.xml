      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="16" confidence="possible">Abstract Topology is the general mathematical theory of convergence. Distributed computing is the formal investigation of communicating concurrent processes. We explore applications of topology to distributed computing in two directions: (1) Point-set topology and (2) algebraic topology. We use the former to study the topological structure of infinite execution trees. This enables us to unify a number of impossibility proofs, in particular, the impossibility of distributed consensus — the task of all processes in a system agreeing on a single value — in various (close to) asynchronous systems with crash failures. The latter is used to look into the combinatorial structure of configurations , i.e., the collection of current process states in the system. Configurations are regarded as simplices in a simplicial complex, and topological incompatibility of such complexes is utilized to prove the impossibility of a generalization of distributed consensus in certain systems. The particular problem considered is k -set agreement , which is the task of letting all processes agree to values within a set of at most k elements.</region>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="17" confidence="possible">Kurzfassung Topologie ist die mathematisch adäquate Art, um über Konvergenz zu sprechen. Distributed Computing ist das formale Studium von verteilten Systemen. Die Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit zwei Anwendungen der Topologie im Bereich des Distributed Computing: (1) Mengentheoretische Topologie und (2) algebraische Topologie. Erstere wird verwendet, um die topologische Struktur von unendlichen Bäumen, die die Information über mögliche Ausführungen der Algorithmen sub- sumieren, zu untersuchen. Dieses Wissen wird verwendet, um einen einheitlichen Beweis der Unmöglichkeit von Distributed Consensus in mehreren Systemmo- dellen zu geben. Consensus ist das Einigen aller Prozesse des Systems auf einen einzigen Wert. Zweitere wird verwendet, um die kombinatorische Struktur von Konfiguratio- nen , also der Zusammenfassung aller lokaler Zustände der Prozesse, zu untersuchen. Hierbei wird eine Konfiguration als Simplex in einem Simplizialkomplex aufgefasst. Die topologische Unvereinbarkeit solcher Komplexe ermöglicht einen Beweis der Unmöglichkeit von k -Set Agreement in gewissen Systemen. Das ist eine Verallgemeinerung des Consensus-Problems: Es wird nicht mehr verlangt, dass sich die Prozesse auf nur einen Wert einigen, sondern es wird erlaubt, dass bis zu k unterschiedliche Werte auftreten.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="43" page="7" column="1">This thesis deals with applications of topology to distributed computing. These are twofold: Firstly, we use point-set topology to provide a unifying topological framework for consensus impossibility proofs.

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="44" page="7" column="1">1.1. Distributed Computing</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="45" page="7" column="1">Consider a system of N processes that communicate by means of passing messages. All processes take steps simultaneously at times t = 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . and in zero time. All message delays are equal to 1 / 2, i.e., processes at time t +1 have received all messages sent in computing steps at time t . Processes are modeled as state machines and run a local algorithm which governs state transitions and message sendings. Interesting questions to ask might include:</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="46" confidence="possible" page="7" column="1">(1) How many steps does it take until the last process has terminated? (2) How many messages are sent in the execution of the algorithm? (3) Is the algorithm correct, i.e., does it indeed fulfill its task specification?</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="47" page="7" column="1">The investigation of such questions is the realm of distributed computing . We can spice things up a bit by varying model parameters. For example, we may allow more general message delays than fixing them all at exactly 1 / 2. Likewise, we might choose not to fix the times at which processes take steps to exactly 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . Of course, also the restriction that all processes take steps simultaneously might seem overly limiting. We may also introduce the possibility of lost messages: In the completely synchronous model with message delays equal to 1 / 2, suppose that in every time frame [ t, t + 1), up to N − 1 message may be lost. That is, these messages do not get delivered although all other messages are delivered timely. A surprising result (Santoro and Widmayer 1989) is that even in such a system with relatively few faults (there exist up to N 2 − N point-to-point links; at most N − 1 are lossy each round) it is impossible for any deterministic algorithm to solve consensus . Consensus is the task of all processes in the system agreeing on a single value.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="72" page="10" column="1">Distributed computing (Attiya and Welch 2004, Lynch 1996) is the investigation of concurrent processes that communicate by means of some communication medium. Commonly, processes are modeled as deterministic state machines taking steps (performing state transitions) in zero time. Examples of communication media include point-to-point RS232 links, a common data bus or a shared memory area allocated by the Linux kernel. These types of communicating differ in a number of properties: While changes to a shared memory are potentially visible immediately, messages which were sent at time t may arrive at time t + δ with δ &gt; 0, i.e., the message sent at time t is not immediately visible to the receiver. The transmission delay on a bus might be equal for all processes, while transmission delays on point-to-point links might be different for different links (processes). In message-passing systems, a fundamental distinction is whether message delays are bounded or not. Message delays are bounded if there is a constant ∆ such that every message sent at time t is guaranteed to have arrived at time t + ∆. Systems that lack this property are called message asynchronous . Other important properties of communicating distributed systems are process synchrony properties. The most process synchronous system imaginable might be a system in which all processes run at exactly the same speed, i.e., steps of processes are triggered by perfectly synchronous hardware clocks. A most process asynchronous system is one in which no information whatsoever is available on when processes take a step (perform a state transition). Of course, systems with more synchrony allow for harder problems to be solved than systems with weaker synchrony. It is, for example, impossible to do any kind of real-time clock synchronization in completely asynchronous systems. A major problem, however, is to determine whether one system is “more synchronous” than some other system (e.g., Dolev, Dwork, and Stockmeyer 1987) and for many pairs of systems, none is more synchronous than the other. <marker type="page" number="11"/><marker type="block"/> Things get even more complicated when components may fail, in particular, in asynchronous systems where no upper bound on message delays or inter-step times of processes exist. The seminal work of Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson (1985) shows that it is not possible in such systems for processes to even agree on a single value (i.e., consensus is not possible). The following sections introduce a number of popular models for distributed systems.</region>

An algorithm in the asynchronous message-passing system model consists of a state machine for each of the N processes. State changes occur when a process takes a step and the transition function depends on the current internal state and received messages. Apart from the internal state transition, a process may also send messages to other processes.

These registers can hold an unbounded amount of information and support two types of operations: read and write . Operation read ( R ) returns the value of register R and operation write ( R, v ) writes value v to register R . The fundamental limitation in this model is that processes can perform only one of the operations read and write in a single computing step. Hence a process performing a write does not know which value it overwrites. As in asynchronous message-passing, there is no upper bound on inter-step times of processes. 2 Also, the possibility of processes crashing introduces difficulties. A sometimes convenient simplification is to limit registers to be single-writer registers. That is, a shared register has a single process assigned to it which is the only process that may write to the register. It is known (Attiya and Welch 2004, Theorem 10.9) that this is not a serious restriction.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="126" page="15" column="1">The notions of safety and liveness properties were introduced by Lamport (1977) and have been well adopted in the distributed computing community. Lamport used these notions to subdivide correctness proofs of programs into smaller and more homogeneous pieces. <marker type="page" number="16"/><marker type="block"/> Intuitively, a safety property is the statement that “something will not happen” (Lamport 1977). For instance, take the sentence “No message is ever sent.” The “thing” that should not happen according to this statement is that a message is sent. At any time in an execution, if already a message was sent, there is no way that the execution fulfills the above safety property, no matter how the execution continues. Hence if a “bad thing” happened in an execution prefix, any execution that extends this prefix does not fulfill the safety property. A liveness property is the statement that “something must happen” (Lamport 1977). An example would be the sentence “Every message that was sent is eventually received.” The important point is that at any time in an execution, even if not all sent messages were received yet, it is still possible that the execution fulfills the above liveness property (because the message can be received later). Hence for any finite execution prefix, there exists an execution extending this prefix that fulfills the liveness property. The immediate formalization of these two notions is contained in the following definition.<marker type="block"/> Definition 2.1. Let S A be the set of admissible executions of some algorithm A . A property of executions is a subset P ⊂ S A . We call a property P a safety property if the following holds: For all E ∈ S A \ P exists some n ∈ N such that every E ∈ S A that coincides with E in the first n components holds E ∈ P . We call a property P a liveness property if the following holds: For all E ∈ S A and every n ∈ N there exists an E ∈ P that coincides with E in the first n components.<marker type="block"/> It should be noted that the intuitive meaning of these notions is sometimes in conflict with Definition 2.1, in particular in the presence of failures. An investigation of this problem and alternative definitions were given by Charron-Bost, Toueg, and Basu (2000).</region>

By the term “problem” we mean a specification on the behavior of an algorithm, which is said to “solve a problem” if all its executions satisfy the specification. The reason why we introduce exactly these two problems is firstly their fundamentality and secondly that we will prove impossibility of their solution in specific system models in later chapters.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="131" page="17" column="1">Informally, consensus is the task of getting all processes in a distributed system to agree on a single value. It is known (e.g., Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson 1985, Dolev, Dwork, and Stockmeyer 1987, Fich and Ruppert 2003) that consensus, as easy as the problem specification might seem, is in fact impossible to solve in a variety of system models in the presence of faults. Every process starts its execution with a prescribed input value and decides upon termination on an output value. We will consider consensus only in system models with model parameter f 1. Otherwise, consensus is trivially solvable. One simplification 1 that we make is that the set of possible input and output values is equal to { 0 , 1 } . This special case of consensus is called binary consensus. Formally, input and output values are modeled in the following way: First, we impose the restriction that every process has to have at least two distinct initial states. For every process p j , let S j denote its set of states and I j ⊂ S j its set of initial states. We demand | I j | 2. Input values are modeled by a mapping ι j : I j → { 0 , 1 } which we demand to be non-trivial. Output values are modeled by a mapping δ j : S j → { 0 , 1 , ⊥} . We say that process p j has decided on v ∈ { 0 , 1 } in state s ∈ S j if δ j ( s ) = v . We demand that decisions are irrevocable , i.e., if s is part of some configuration C , δ j ( s ) ∈ { 0 , 1 } , and configuration C follows C in some execution, then δ j ( s ) = δ j ( s ) where s is p j ’s state in C . Hence, we may extend δ j to execution of the algorithm. Of course, even with f crash failures, agreement on a value can be achieved trivially by programming every process to decide on 0. Hence, we limit our attention to non- trivial consensus. We say that an algorithm solves consensus if: 1 In reality, this does not make the problem any simpler, just the notation. And since we are doing impossibility results, it suffices to limit ourselves to this special case.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="148" page="19" column="1">This section introduces the necessary tools for formulating the main result of this thesis in Section 4.2. We show how to equip a space of executions of some distributed algorithm with a certain topology that helps us express executional properties in a topological manner. But before we talk about execution spaces , we have to fix the term “execution” and explain what we mean by it. 1 Common to all models of distributed computing is the notion of a configuration , meaning a snapshot of the state of a system. That is, a configuration encompasses information about the internal state of every process and the state of the communication medium (e.g., messages in transit or contents of shared memory). An execution is a sequence of configurations such that each configuration in the sequence is a successor of the former ones. Notice that the meaning of these two notions is heavily model-dependent. From the topological viewpoint, we are not interested in the ontological question of what a configuration really is ; we only need to know which successor configurations are possible. Thus, we “shift focus from the structure of protocols for a distributed system to the structure of the set of possible schedules of a distributed system.” (Saks and Zaharoglou 2000) We denote by C A the set of all configurations of algorithm A . Let S A denote the set of admissible executions, which is a subset of the set C A ω of sequences of configurations. 2 We will equip the latter space with a natural topology that induces a topology on its subset S A . When there is no danger of ambiguity, we will write C and S for C A and S A , respectively.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="166" page="21" column="1">Finally, we endow S ⊂ C ω with the subset topology (Example A.9), that is, the topology induced by the same metric. This topology on execution spaces was introduced by Alpern and Schneider (1985). They characterized safety and liveness properties of executions in a topological way. Namely, a property is a safety property if and only if the set of executions satisfying it is closed (Definition A.8) with respect to the previously defined topology. Similarly, a property is a liveness property if and only if the set of executions satisfying it is dense (Definition A.11) with respect to this topology. They used this characterization to prove that any property is an intersection of a safety and a liveness property. Also, in non-pathological cases, every property is an intersection of two liveness properties. We will now retrace these insights. In the following, let C be the set of configurations of some algorithm. Lemma 4.2. A property P ⊂ C ω is a safety property if and only if P is closed in C ω . <marker type="block"/> Proof. It is equivalent to prove that P is a safety property if and only if its complement P c is open. Let P be a safety property. Then, by definition, for every E ∈ P c , there exists some index k such that for every E ∈ C ω that agrees with E in the first k components, we have E ∈ P c . By setting ε = 2 − k , we arrive at the insight that B ε ( E ) ⊂ P c and we are done. Conversely, let P c be an open set. Let E ∈ P c . We have to show that there exists some index k such that for any E ∈ C ω that coincides with E in the first k components, we have E ∈ P c . The set P c being open, there exists some ε &gt; 0 such that B ε ( E ) ⊂ P c . Let k ∈ N such that 2 − k &lt; ε . Then the set of all E that coincide with E in the first k components is a subset of B ε ( E ), which concludes the proof. Lemma 4.3. A property P ⊂ C ω is a liveness property if and only if P is dense in C ω .<marker type="block"/> Proof. Let P be a liveness property and let E ∈ C ω and ε &gt; 0. We will show that there exists some E ∈ P such that d ( E, E ) &lt; ε . Let k ∈ N such that 2 − k &lt; ε . By definition of liveness, there exists an extension E of the execution fragment formed by taking the first k components of E such that E ∈ P . But then d ( E, E ) &lt; 2 − k &lt; ε and we are done. Conversely, let P be a dense set. Let ( C 0 , C 1 , . . . , C k ) be an execution fragment. We have to show that there exists some extension E ∈ P of the fragment. Let E be any extension of the fragment. Because P is dense, there exists E ∈ P such that d ( E, E ) &lt; 2 − k − 1 , which shows that E is also an extension of ( C 0 , C 1 , . . . , C k ).</region>

We used these notions in a “global” sense, meaning that they were understood with respect to the whole space C ω . When considering a specific algorithm running in a specific model, however, we may mean something different by “safety” and “liveness”. For example, consider a consensus algorithm A with set S ⊂ C ω of admissible executions. Then C 0 , the set of initial configurations of A , is not equal to C , because there exist configurations in which processes have decided, but no process has decided in an initial configuration. It follows that S is not dense in C ω , since every E ∈ S starts with an initial configuration. Hence S , as a property in C ω , is not a liveness property. But S itself is of course a liveness (and even a safety) property in S . It follows that the notions of safety and liveness are relative notions. Of course, statements analog to that of Lemma 4.2 and Lemma 4.3 hold relative to some set S of executions.</region>

            <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="175" page="22" column="1">In this subsection, we will demonstrate topological proof techniques for impossibility results with the help of a simple example. Consider a consensus algorithm A for N 3 processes communicating by means of single-reader multiple-writer shared read-write registers. 4 Of these processes, f = N − 1 might fail by crashing. According to Section 2.4, a configuration C in this model consists of a tuple ( s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s N ) and a tuple ( v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v M ) where s i is the internal state of process p i and v i is the content of a shared memory register. An event in this system model is a process number j ∈ { 1 , 2 , . . . , N } , which expresses that process p j takes a step. An admissible schedule is a sequence of process numbers in which at least one process occurs infinitely often (recall that f = N − 1). Hence every sequence in { 1 , 2 , . . . , N } N is an admissible schedule. We work with two sequence spaces: the space of schedules and the space of executions. In this example, the set of schedules is equal to Σ = { 1 , . . . , N } N and the set S of admissible executions of some algorithm is a subset of C ω where C denotes the set of all configurations. We equip both sets with the topology discussed at the beginning of Section 4.1. 4 This is very similar to the model of Dolev, Dwork, and Stockmeyer 1987, Theorem I1.1 and a special case of the system model in Section 2.4.</region>

But by Tychonoff’s theorem (Theorem A.3), Σ and also C 0 × Σ are compact. Hence S is a continuous image of a compact space, which implies that S itself is compact (Lemma A.10). Since C ω is metrizable, hence Hausdorff, we conclude that S is closed in C ω (Lemma A.9). Thus, S is a safety property in C ω (Lemma 4.2). The established continuity (both ∆ and f I are continuous) of ∆ ◦ f I : Σ → { 0 , 1 } for I ∈ C 0 has the following consequence: The sets Σ α , α ∈ { 0 , 1 } , of schedules σ for which ∆( f I ( σ )) = α , i.e., where the algorithm decides on α in execution f I ( σ ), are closed in Σ, because they are inverse images of the closed sets { α } ⊂ { 0 , 1 } under a continuous mapping. Being closed in a compact space, the sets Σ α are compact (Lemma A.9). But since each of these two sets is the complement of the other in Σ, they are also open. The following lemma now establishes a uniform bound K such that every execution starting from I is univalent after the K th step. By passing to the maximum over all I ∈ C 0 , we get a uniform bound K not restricted to a particular initial configuration. In other words, C K is univalent for every ( C 0 , C 1 , . . . , C K , . . . ) ∈ S . Lemma 4.6 (Lebesgue) .

We show that such a fork is impossible. 7 Then, we have proved consensus impossibility. Let p be the process taking the step C → D 0 and let q be the process taking the step C → D 1 .

The resulting decision value (the value that r decides on) is in both cases the same, because the local state of r and all register values that r can read are the same in D 0 and D 1 . But since D 0 is 0-valent and D 1 is 1-valent, this is a contradiction. Case 2: p performs a read and q performs a write operation. The same trick as in Case 1 works.

            <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="197" page="25" column="1">Executions are sequences of configurations. At any point (configuration) in such a sequence, it is often possible to choose from more than one successor configuration, as governed by the system model and the algorithm. One can, in a natural way, assign a decision tree to any set of executions that captures the decision of choosing a successor. We will characterize in Section 4.1.3 certain sets of executions whose decision trees capture all the information about the original set. This follows an idea by Lubitch and Moran (1995). Let C be the set of configurations of an algorithm A and let S ⊂ C ω . We will construct a tree T ( S ) that reflects the local decisions of choosing a successor configuration. We construct it inductively, of course. First of all, we insert a root ⊥ . We then connect to it nodes labeled with every configuration C 0 that occurs as an initial configuration in S , see Figure 4.2. These are exactly the vertices at depth 1. Suppose now that we already constructed the tree up to depth n . We describe how to construct the vertices at depth n + 1. Let C n − 1 be a vertex at depth n . There exists a unique path ( ⊥ , C 0 , C 1 , . . . , C n − 1 ) from ⊥ to C n − 1 . We connect to C n − 1 6 Existence of a bivalent initial configuration is established by a bit-flipping argument.

In particular, vertices are not configurations, but only labeled by configurations. Hence it is indeed possible that there exist two different nodes in T ( S ) that are labeled with the same configuration. The labels of nodes at depth n are exactly the configurations that occur in the ( n − 1)th component of executions in S . Also, nodes in this tree may have infinite degree. But, as we will see later, for any specific distributed system model and algorithm running on it, the tree of the set of admissible executions will be locally finite, i.e., nodes will have finite degree. By construction, every execution in S corresponds to an infinite path in the tree T ( S ). The converse, however, is not true in general. There exist sets S and infinite paths in T ( S ) that do not correspond to an execution in S . For example, consider a shared memory algorithm for N 3 processes and up to f = N − 2 crash faults. The corresponding set S contains all sequences of process numbers with the property that at least two processes occur infinitely often. In the tree T ( S ) every node has exactly N children — one for every process. Hence the infinite path (1 , 1 , . . . ) exists in T ( S ), but this sequence is not an element of S .

Denote the set of possible configurations in the n th component by C n . Then, S ⊂ n ∈ ω C n . The latter set being compact (Theorem A.3 and Example A.10), the compactness of S follows from Lemma A.9(1). Finally, let S be compact. Let v be any vertex in T ( S ). We will show that v has only finitely many children. Suppose that v = ⊥ is the root and ⊥ has infinitely many children, i.e., C 0 is infinite. Consider the following open covering of S :</region>

We then know that the K α are compact, because the decision function ∆ is continuous. But this is a direct contradiction to Theorem 4.3. We will, however, use a slightly different argument to derive a contradiction. Most often, we will not directly reason with sequences of configurations. What we will rather do is follow an idea which was introduced by Lubitch and Moran (1995) and generalized by Moses and Rajsbaum (2002): We use schedulers to construct executions. Definition 4.1.

A scheduler is called closed if X is compact.<marker type="block"/> We will use schedulers to describe the construction of executions in a (closed) subset of S (namely the image of f ). An example of a scheduler is the above mapping f of Section 4.1.1. We prominently used the fact that f and in particular that ∆ ◦ f was a continuous mapping. The general result about transportation of properties in Theorem 4.3 is the following lemma. Lemma 4.7. Let f : X → S be a closed scheduler. The following assertions are true:</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="229" page="29" column="1">Proof. (1): Every closed set A ⊂ X is compact since X is compact (Lemma A.9(1)). Since f is continuous, we may deduce that f [ A ] is compact (Lemma A.10). But S is Hausdorff and hence every compact set is closed by Lemma A.9(2); in particular f [ A ]. (2): Let d ( A, B ) = 0. If we set ε k = 2 − k we get by the uniform continuity of f (similar to Theorem A.2) the existence of δ k &gt; 0 such that d ( x, y ) &lt; δ k ⇒ d ( f ( x ) , f ( y )) &lt; 2 − k (4.15) By hypothesis there exist sequences ( a k ) in A and ( b k ) in B such that d ( a k , b k ) &lt; δ k for all k ∈ N .

Hence a closed scheduler X can be viewed as the set of paths in the locally finite tree T ( X ); see Theorem 4.2. Often, the set L will be a set of layers (Moses and Rajsbaum 2002), i.e., each ∈ L will correspond to a finite sequence of events. For example, a layer in the shared memory model will be every process taking one step in some fixed order. The fact that each layer is a fixed finite sequence of events will immediately establish continuity of f . Hence the continuity of ∆ ◦ f where ∆ is the decision function will establish the compactness of both X 0 and X 1 where X α is the set of schedules in which the algorithm decides on α . It remains to show d ( X 0 , X 1 ) = 0 to complete the impossibility proof by virtue of Theorem 4.3 — see Section 4.2.1. In a way, a scheduler f : X → S defines a sub-model of S . This is particular apparent if we consider schedulers that consist of sequences of layers: In S , it is defined which configurations may follow which. The layering limits these possibilities and takes “shortcuts” from one configuration to another. Thus, the tree T ( X ) can be seen as a sub-tree of T ( S ) in some sense with the additional convenient property that P T ( X ) = X (if we are considering a closed scheduler).</region>

We choose <marker type="block"/> L π = { aok π , except π } ∪ { delayed π ( i ) | 1 i N } (4.16) for any permutation 9 π ∈ S N , L = π ∈ S N L π as the set of layers, and X = L N . The mapping f : X → S is defined to be the application of a sequence of layers to these initial configurations. More precisely, every layer in L is defined to be a finite sequence of events (see below for the exact definition) and the application of a sequence ( 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . ) of layers to an initial configuration C 0 is defined by concatenating all layers to a single schedule σ and taking the corresponding sequence of steps. It remains to describe the layers aok π , except π and delayed π ( i ). In layer aok π , every process takes steps in the order governed by the permutation π , i.e., in the order p π (1) , p π (2) , . . . , p π ( N ) , each process receives all messages sent to it thus far. Layer except π is the same as aok π except that process p π ( N ) does not take steps. In layer delayed π ( i ), processes take steps in the order of π and all messages are received except for messages sent from p π ( i ) to p π ( i )+1 mod N in this very layer. (They are likely to be received in the next layer — namely if and only if the recipient takes a step in the next layer.) We equip the finite set L with the discrete topology and X = L N with the product topology. Finite sets are always compact and by Tychonoff’s theorem (Theorem A.3), also X is compact. The mapping f is continuous, because the n th component of f ( x ) only depends on the first n components of x ∈ X . 10 Hence we are dealing with a closed scheduler. Let C be a configuration. For any layer ∈ L , let C · denote the configuration that arises when applying to C . We want to show that the precondition of Lemma 4.8 is fulfilled.

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="272" page="34" column="1">Algebraic topology splits up into two major threads: homotopy and homology. An example of a construction used in homotopy is the fundamental group of a (path- connected) topological space X . It is defined as the quotient of the group of all loops, i.e., continuous maps [0 , 1] → X starting from and ending at the same point x 0 ∈ X where the group operation is defined as the juxtaposition of two loops, with respect to the equivalence relation of homotopy, i.e., continuous deformability of one loop to another. A very natural question to ask is which topological spaces have trivial fundamental groups, i.e., in which spaces are all loops continuously deformable into each other. The class of these spaces is called the class of simply connected spaces. The other major branch of algebraic topology is homology. Similar to homotopy, it deals with spaces of continuous mappings [0 , 1] q → X , but unlike homotopy, it does not directly define a group operation on this set, but rather factors the free Abelian group generated by these mappings with respect to a certain equivalence relation. We will need a few techniques from homology in the course of this chapter and we provide a brief introduction to this topic in Section 5.2. Turning to the world of distributed computing again, what we will do in this chapter is proving impossibility of k -set agreement in asynchronous systems communicating by read-write registers in the presence of up to k crash failures. The proof that we present here was developed by Herlihy and Shavit (1993). Its strategy is to introduce a structure on the set of local processor states of an algorithm, namely that of a simplicial complex and reason that the subcomplex of final configurations (configurations in which enough processes have decided) is incompatible with the so- called output complex, i.e., a simplical complex describing decisions that are allowed by the problem statement.</region>

            <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="279" page="35" column="1">In this section, we will discuss the basic algebraic objects we will encounter along the way. These are chain complexes and more generally graded Abelian groups . Let A ∗ = ( A k ) k ∈ Z be a sequence of Abelian groups. Then we call A ∗ a graded Abelian group . A morphism φ of degree m ∈ Z from A ∗ to B ∗ is a sequence φ k : A k → B k + m of Abelian group morphisms. We denote a morphism of degree m = 0 plainly by the name morphism . That is, a graded Abelian group is just an enumerable collection of Abelian groups and a morphism is just an enumerable collection of Abelian group morphisms. A chain complex ( A ∗ , ∂ ) is a graded Abelian group A ∗ together with a morphism ∂ of degree − 1 from A ∗ to itself, i.e., for every k ∈ Z we have that ∂ k : A k → A k − 1 is an Abelian group morphism, with the additional property that ∂ k ◦ ∂ k +1 = 0 for all k ∈ Z . This restriction is the same as saying that the image im ∂ k +1 is a subset of the kernel 1 ker ∂ k . We call ∂ the boundary operator of the chain complex. A morphism φ : C → D of graded Abelian groups between chain complexes is a morphism of chain complexes if and only if for all k ∈ Z it holds that φ k − 1 ◦ ∂ k C = ∂ k D ◦ φ k . In other words, the diagram in Figure 5.1 commutes.</region>

            <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="348" page="42" column="1">When considering an initial configuration ( an input simplex) of a decision task, one may ask which final configurations , i.e., configurations in which all processes have halted (decided or crashed), are reachable from this initial configuration. The answer to this question defines a mapping from input simplices to sets of final configurations. For an input simplex S ∈ I with dim S n − t − 1, i.e., | S | n − t , we define the complex P ( S ) to be the reachable subcomplex of P where only processes take steps that appear in S with initial states as specified in S . The set of configurations (viewed as simplices) that occur in the image of this mapping define a complex, the protocol complex . It encompasses the information which final configurations may occur when running the protocol (algorithm). To be more precise, a simplex S = { C j 1 , C j 2 , C j 3 , . . . , C j r } (5.17) is in the protocol complex if and only if</region>

More precisely, a final state C j gets mapped to α ∈ { 1 , 2 , . . . , M } if and only if process p j has decided to α in state C j .

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="373" page="45" column="1">We investigated two applications of topology to problems in distributed computing. These were impossibility proofs of (a) consensus in a number of 1-resilient systems and (b) k -set agreement in asynchronous k -resilient systems. For this, we used methods from (a) point-set topology and (b) algebraic topology. Point-set topology helped us in providing a way of reasoning about execution trees in a unified way to prove impossibility of consensus. We regarded an execution as a sequence of configurations and equipped the sequence space of all possible executions with a metric which had the property that those executions are close together which share a long common prefix. We then used schedulers to pass to a closed (hence compact) subspace of the space of all executions. This subspace satisfied the precondition of Lebesgue’s lemma which provided a uniform step bound after which every configuration is univalent. A model-dependent analysis of configuration similarity then concluded the impossibility proofs. Algebraic topology, in particular homology, was introduced to examine simplicial complexes. To utilize this, we considered input and output complexes of decision tasks and configuration complexes of protocols (algorithms). The function that maps input simplices to the complex of possible final configurations starting from it turned out to be an acyclic carrier. This was then used to derive the impossibility of wait-free k -set consensus, following Herlihy and Shavit (1993).</region>

In the following, we will generalize the ideas of this example to spaces that are equipped with some way of measuring distances. These spaces are known as metric spaces . <marker type="block"/> Metric spaces are an immediate generalization of Euclidean spaces. As with any generalization, the idea is to purposely ignore certain aspects and properties of the<marker type="page" number="50"/><marker type="block"/> object in question and focus on just a very limited number of properties that these objects have in common. In our case, the important notion that generalizes Euclidean spaces to metric spaces is that of distance . The idea is to forget everything we know about the Euclidean norm · except that we may use it to define the distance of two points x and y by taking the norm of their difference. Thus, we take the entity “norm” and build a new machine out of it: A machine that takes two points as input and outputs a number — their distance d ( x, y ). After identifying a notion that lends itself to generalization, it is crucial to work out which basic properties have to be attributed to it such that one can define the notion by means of these properties. We already have listed these properties for our case: Properties (1), (2), (3) from Example A.1 which we will use in the following definition.</region>

Let us begin by proving that every union of open sets is again open: Let A ι be open sets for every ι in some non-empty index set I and denote their set-theoretic union by A . We will show that A is open. For every x ∈ A , by the definition of union, there exists some ι 0 such that x ∈ A ι 0 .

We have just glanced at a very important notion: that of a basis of a topology. With this notion, we can express the last result as: The balls form a basis of the topology that is induced by the metric. We may now ask, of course, if intersections of open sets are again open.

Compactness is a property of a subset of a topological space that can “make local things global”. An example for this would be the well-known theorem “A continuous real function defined on the interval [ a, b ] is uniformly continuous”. Here, the set [ a, b ] is compact, continuity is a local property and uniform continuity is a global property. We start with the Definition A.2. A set C ⊂ R n is compact if it is bounded (i.e., there some ball with radius R &gt; 0 that contains C ) and its complement is an open set. <marker type="block"/> The most important property of compact sets is the following Theorem whose proof’s insight-length ratio is too low to demonstrate it here.

Most important and a major source of misunderstandings is the following triviality: The condition does not claim that there has to exist some finite family of open sets that covers C . This would be trivially fulfilled by any set since R n as a subset of itself is an open set and covers any other. The condition reads that any open covering of C , no matter how ugly it might look like, has to have a finite subcovering. This observation is of utmost importance. We will now proceed by showing the result announced in the introduction to this subsection whose proof exemplifies the routinely used reasoning known as “compact- ness argument”. For this, we recall some basic definitions from calculus. Definition A.3 (Continuity) . Let U be a subset of R and f : U → R a function. The function f is called continuous at a point x ∈ U if the following condition is satisfied: For every ε &gt; 0 there exists some δ &gt; 0 such that x ∈ U and | x − x | &lt; δ implies | f ( x ) − f ( x ) | &lt; ε . The function f is called continuous if f is continuous at every point x ∈ U . Definition A.4 (Uniform continuity) . Let U be a subset of R and f : U → R a function. The function f is called uniformly continuous if the following condition is satisfied: For every ε &gt; 0 exists some δ &gt; 0 such that x, x ∈ U and | x − x | &lt; δ implies | f ( x ) − f ( x ) | &lt; ε . <marker type="page" number="54"/><marker type="block"/> Of course, uniform continuity implies continuity, but the converse is not true in general as the example U = R and f ( x ) = x 2 shows. Our goal for now, however, will be to show that the converse does hold in a special case, namely that of compact intervals. The set of compact real intervals is quite easy to determine: It is exactly the set of bounded closed intervals [ a, b ]. The following proof is a most prototypical compactness argument.</region>

Definition A.7 (Convergence) . Let X be a topological space and ( x k ) k ∈ N ∈ X N a sequence in X . We say that ( x k ) converges to the point x ∈ X if for every neighborhood N of x , there exists some integer K ∈ N such that for every k K , x k ∈ N .

The generalization of Definition A.7 is that the prototypical neighborhoods B ε ( x ) were replaced by arbitrary neighborhoods of x . One fact we recall from Example A.3 is that in the case of a metric space X , every open set is the union of ε -balls. In such a case, we call the set of ε -balls a basis of the topology. More specifically, a basis B of a topology T on X is a set of subsets of X such that every open set O ∈ T is a union of elements of B . Trivially, the topology itself is always a basis. A special case occurs when there exists a countable basis B of a topology. These spaces are called second countable or AA2 spaces. Euclidean spaces R n have a basis consisting of the ε -balls. But they even are AA2 spaces since the set of balls with rational radius and rational center also form a basis of the Euclidean topology, i.e.,</region>

AA2 spaces are spaces in which it suffices to use the term “sequence”, i.e., a mapping N → X , when talking about convergence. In other spaces it might be too restrictive for its notion of convergence that the domain N of the sequence is just countable. We would have to generalize sequences to either nets or filters , the former being mappings Λ → X where Λ is not necessarily countable, but has to carry an additional structure; that of a directed set 1 . If this is not done, popular theorems such as “A map F : X → Y is continuous if and only if for each sequence x k in 1 A directed set is a set Λ together with a preorder (reflexive and transitive relation) on Λ such that for every λ and μ in Λ, there exists a ν such that λ ν and μ ν . <marker type="page" number="58"/><marker type="block"/> X converging to x , the sequence f ( x k ) converges to f ( x )” would be plainly false. It is true in any topological space, however, if the word “sequence” is replaced by “net”. But the introduction of this generalization has a few complications attached to it. For example, it need not be the case that a net has only one limit, but it may have multiple. There even exist nets that converge to every point in the space. Nevertheless, we will not take on the endeavor to explore the theory in this direction since the spaces we will look at do not have this inconvenience. We call a topological space Hausdorff if for every two distinct points x and y , there exist neighborhoods N x and N y of x and y , respectively, such that N x ∩ N y = ∅ .

We will construct a sequence of points in B that converges to x , deriving the desired contradiction. In a first step, we will show that there exists a sequence of points in R that converges to x and then show how this implies the claim. By hypothesis, there exists some countable basis B of the topology. Let ( N k ) k ∈ N denote the family of basis sets that contain x .

It is the purpose of this section to deal with “morphisms” of such objects, i.e., functions between topological spaces that preserve the topological structure. We will then have laid the ground to study the category of topological spaces (Herrlich and Strecker 1973). <marker type="block"/> Definition A.12 (Continuity) . Let X and Y be topological spaces. Furthermore, let f : X → Y be a function. We call f continuous if for every open set O ⊂ Y , it follows that its inverse image f − 1 [ O ] is open in X .</region>

Then every map f : X → Y is continuous, because every subset of X is open. Conversely, if Y is equipped with the trivial topology, i.e., only ∅ and Y are open, then again every map f : X → Y is continuous, because f − 1 [ ∅ ] = ∅ and f − 1 [ Y ] = X which are in any case open in X . <marker type="page" number="64"/><marker type="block"/> If Y a topological space and X is any non-empty set, we may ask ourselves with which topology we must equip X such that a given mapping f : X → Y becomes continuous. Of course, we want to do this in the most general fashion, i.e., we do not want to add too many open sets to the to be defined topology on X , just enough to make f continuous. We are obliged to have sets of the form f − 1 [ O ] where O ⊂ Y is open as open sets in X . But by recalling all those useful properties of the inverse image, it also turns out that these sets are enough: The sets of the above form f − 1 [ O ] form a topology on X with respect to which f is continuous. We call this topology on X the initial topology with respect to f : X → Y .<marker type="block"/> Example A.9 (Subspace topology) . If X ⊂ Y and Y is equipped with a topology, we may consider the inclusion map ι : X → Y , i.e., ι ( x ) = x for all x ∈ X , and equip X with the initial topology with respect to ι . We call this topology on X the subspace topology inherited from Y . The open sets of X are exactly the sets X ∩ O where O ⊂ Y is open.<marker type="block"/> We may well go the opposite direction and ask, given a mapping f : X → Y where X is a topological space and Y is an arbitrary non-empty set, which topology on Y makes f continuous and has the least number of open sets. This time, it turns out that indeed the sets A ⊂ Y such that f − 1 [ A ] ⊂ X is open form a topology on Y . This topology on Y is called the final topology with respect to f : X → Y . We have already seen a notion called “continuity” in Definition A.3 where we defined it for maps U → R where U ⊂ R . It would be embarrassing if those notions would not agree for maps U → R .

            <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="651" page="65" column="1">We briefly discussed compactness in Section A.1.2 for the case of subsets of R n . Since we do not have the notion of distance and hence boundedness in general topological spaces, the idea is to take the conclusion of Theorem A.1 as the definition of compactness. Below, we collect the most important facts about compact sets. Definition A.13 (Compactness) . Let X be a topological space. We call X compact if for any collection ( A ι ) ι ∈ I of open sets for which X = A ι , there exists some n ∈ N n and ι 1 , . . . , ι n such that X = k =1 A ι k . We call a subset A of a topological space compact if A is compact with respect to the subspace topology inherited from X . Example A.10. A space equipped with the discrete topology is compact if and only if it is finite. This follows easily because all singleton sets { x } are open in discrete spaces. Lemma A.9. Let X be a topological space and A ⊂ X . The following assertions are true:</region>

Since X is compact, there exist finitely many indices ι 1 , . . . , ι n such that X = n k =1 A ι k ∪ ( X \ A ). By intersecting both sides with A , we n arrive at A = k =1 A ι k which shows that A is compact. (2): We show that the complement of A is open. Let x ∈ X \ A . By the Hausdorff property, for every y ∈ A , there exist disjoint open sets U ( y ) and V ( y ) such that y ∈ U ( y ) and x ∈ V ( y ). The family U ( y ) where y ∈ A is an open covering of n A . Because A is compact, there exist y 1 , . . . , y n such that A = i =1 U ( y i ). Setting n V = i =1 V ( y i ) reveals that V is an open neighborhood of x ((O2) in Definition A.5) which is disjoint to A , hence V ⊂ X \ A .
