        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="8" confidence="possible" page="3" column="1">Formale Spezifikation und Verifikation sind durch die durch kontinuierliche Weiterentwicklung in letzter Zeit an einem Punkt angelangt, wo Programme beinahe automatisch verifiziert werden können. Das Ziel dieser Magisterarbeit ist es, sowohl kommerzielle als auch für wissenschaftliche Zwecke entwickelte Verifikationsprogramme zu testen. Der Hauptaugenmerk liegt auf dem Nutzen dieser Werkzeuge in der Software- Entwicklung und in der Lehre. Hierzu wird diese Magisterarbeit die theoretischen Grundlagen vorstellen und auf die verschiedenen Fähigkeiten und Eigenheiten der ausgewählten Werkzeuge eingehen. Die theoretischen Grundlagen behandeln einerseits Ansätze, die für die formale Verifikation gebraucht werden, andererseits wird die Funktionsweise der ausgewählten Werkzeuge erklärt. Die begutachteten Programme sind der Frege Program Prover, KeY, Perfect Developer und das Prototype Verification System. Die Beispiele, mit denen diese Werkzeuge getestet werden, sind typische Problemstellung der Informatik. Bei der Evaluation wird auf den ganzen Ablauf beim Einsatz dieser Werkzeuge eingegangen und nicht nur auf das Endergebnis. Abstract Formal specification and verification of software have made small but continuous advances throughout its long history, and have reached a point where commercial tools became available for verifying programs semi-automatically or automatically. The aim of the master thesis is to evaluate commercial and academic verification tools with respect to their usability in developing software and in teaching formal methods. The thesis will explain the theoretical foundation and compare the capabilities and characteristics of selected commercial and academic tools on concrete examples. The theoretical foundations deal on the one hand with the general ideas and principles of formal software verification, on the other hand present some internals of the selected tools to give a comprehensive understanding. The discussed tools are the Frege Program Prover, KeY, Perfect Developer, and the Prototype Verification System. The examples encompass simple standard computer science problems. The evaluation of these tools concentrates on the whole development process of specification and verification, not just on the verification results.</region>

      <section class="deo:Introduction">
        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="18" page="7" column="1">1 Introduction</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="19" confidence="possible" page="7" column="1">Formal software verification has become a more and more important issue in developing security related software during the last decades. As a reaction, ISO — the International Organisation for Standardisation — issued the ISO 15408 Standard, defining exactly various quality levels for tested and verified software. This standard is represented in the Common Criteria Project, with members of security organisations around the globe. During the last years, formal specification and verification tools have been introduced, especially designed for standard development processes. The focus ranges from security related projects, over hardware circuit verification to software driver verification. In particular model checking has been very successful. Based on this evolution this thesis deals with four specification and verification tools that enable the user to build software complying with the most demanding restrictions of the ISO 15408 Standard. The aim is to construct software that meets the Evaluation Assurance Levels 6 and 7 (EAL 6, EAL 7) defined in the Common Criteria Project. In other words this means fully verified specification and code. For a long time users of these tools have been assumed to be experts in formal methods. With new target groups requirements changed. Therefore this thesis evaluates the tools with respect to two groups: software engineers with a good knowledge of computer science but without specific training in formal methods, and students of computer science and software engineering in the middle of their studies, being confronted with formal verification tools for the first time. The four tools that will be investigated are the Frege Program Prover, KeY, Perfect Developer, and the Prototype Verification System. In the first part of this work, the theoretical background — main calculi and ideas of formal verification — is presented. Then the internals of the tools are discussed, showing the different approaches and techniques from the theoretical side. Finally, by going through a set of simple standard computer science examples, the different characteristics and capabilities are presented in a practical form. By examining the tools from both sides, theory and practice, their usability in developing software and in teaching formal methods for the above defined target group is discussed.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="21" confidence="possible" page="8" column="1">Historical perspective Formal verification has always been a well discussed problem by a lot of excellent computer scientists. Jones [2003] mentions three phases of historical development:</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="24" page="8" column="1">Pre-Hoare Herman Goldstine, John von Neumann, Alan Turing, Robert Floyd and John McCarthy are only some famous computer pioneers that can be mentioned here. They started thinking about errors in their programs from the start on and had already ideas to avoid them. The idea of assertions for programs was borne. <marker type="block"/> Hoare’s axiomatic approach Tony Hoare presented his axioms in his famous paper Hoare [1969] — the calculus is also discussed in section 2.4 of this thesis. This formulation led to new approaches towards formal verification in the late 1970s.<marker type="block"/> Post-Hoare After Hoare’s axiomatic approach formal verification became a broad scientific research problem with connections to the semantics of programming languages. Many scientists, like Edsger Dijkstra, Tony Hoare himself and many more, continued to work on these foundations and made continuous improvements.</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="25" confidence="possible" page="8" column="1">Until today automatic verification is an intensively considered problem. E.g. Tony Hoare stated the problem of building a “verifying compiler” as one of the big challenges of computer science in his paper Hoare [2003]. Also the idea of reusing verified software is appreciated by the scientific community — Meyer [2003] deals in detail with that idea.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="28" confidence="possible" page="9" column="1">This section deals with general ideas and principles underlying formal software verification and explains basic notions and calculus frameworks. The reader is assumed to have a minimal background on formal logic, especially in classical propositional and first order logic. Detailed explanations of these basics are given in Gallier [2003] or Huth and Ryan [2004]. The following sections discuss an introduction to propositional logic, natural deduction, the sequent calculus, the Hoare calculus and weakest preconditions. We present only rules for propositional logic to give the flavour of the various approaches. Real systems for proving statements about programs are more complex in at least two respects: first, propositional logic has to be extended to first-order or even higher-order logics, i.e., in general we need quantification over first-order or higher-order variables. Second, provers need built-in knowledge about the data types used in programs and formal specifications, like reals and integers, lists and sets. Moreover, special mechanisms have to be provided to deal with equalities, inequalities and other basic theories, using e.g. decision procedures.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="30" confidence="possible" page="9" column="1">This section deals with the basics of propositional classical logic. The following notations will be used as the basic formalism in later chapters. Syntax The alphabet for propositional formulas consists of: A countable set of propositional symbols A i , logical connectives ∨ , ∧ , ¬ , ⊃ , ⊥ and auxiliary symbols (parentheses). Definition 2.1 The set of well formed propositional formulas PROP is in- ductively defined as: Every propositional symbol A i and ⊥ are ∈ PROP , Whenever A, B ∈ PROP , then ¬ A, A ⊃ B, A ∨ B, A ∧ B ∈ PROP .</region>

From now on let φ , ψ and χ denote propositional formulas. The natural deduction rules for propositional logic distinguish between introduction ( i -rules) and elimination ( e -rules) rules for connectives and are defined as follows: Disjunction Rules: φ ψ ∨ i 1 ∨ i 2 φ ∨ ψ φ ∨ ψ φ ∨ ψ φ χ ψ χ ∨ e χ</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="41" confidence="possible" page="12" column="1">The sequent calculus was originally developed by Gentzen, and published in one of his famous papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="40" class="deo:Reference">Gentzen, 1935</xref>]. Definition 2.9 A sequent is a pair (Γ , ∆) of finite multi-sets of propositional formulas. It should be mentioned that some authors (like Fitting [1990]) define a sequent as a set of formulas, others as a sequence. Instead of (Γ , ∆) the notation Γ → ∆ is common. Γ is called antecedent and ∆ succedent . For simplicity, propositional sequents { A 1 , . . . , A n } → { B 1 , . . . , B m } are denoted as A 1 , . . . , A n → B 1 , . . . , B m . Similarly, we write → ∆ and Γ → if Γ and ∆ is empty, respectively. A valuation v makes a sequent A 1 , . . . , A n → B 1 , . . . , B m true iff v | = ( A 1 ∧ . . . ∧ A n ) ⊃ ( B 1 ∨ . . . ∨ B m ) Let Γ, ∆ be arbitrary propositional sequents and let A and B be propo- sitions. The rules in the Gentzen System are then as follows:</region>

This is also denoted by | = ( A 1 , . . . , A n ) → ( B 1 , . . . , B m ) . Definition 2.12 An axiom is any sequent Γ → ∆ such that Γ and ∆ contain some common formula. Proposition 2.13 Every axiom is valid. A deduction tree is a tree whose nodes are labelled with sequents. Every sequent at an inner node must be obtained from the sequents at its children nodes by applying one of the rules of sequent calculus. The label on the root is the sequent that is proved. It is called the conclusion . A proof is a deduction tree that has only axioms as leaves. A counterexample is a sequent consisting only of propositional letters that is no axiom. A failed deduction tree is a deduction tree with a counterexample as one of its leaves. A sequent is provable iff there is a proof tree of which it is the conclusion. If a sequent Γ → ∆ is provable, it is denoted as Γ → ∆ . Proposition 2.14 The Gentzen calculus for formulas in propositional logic is sound. Thus, if a sequent Γ → ∆ is provable, then it is valid. Proposition 2.15 The Gentzen calculus for propositional formulas is complete. Thus, every valid sequent is provable. Furthermore there exists an algorithm for deciding whether a sequent is valid and if so, a proof tree is generated.

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="49" confidence="possible" page="15" column="1">P and Q are logic formulas. In this context they are often called assertions or conditions. P is the precondition and Q is the postcondition . The precondition describes the set of intended initial states for the program S , whereas the postcondition describes the set of final states for S , if S terminates. Definition 2.16 { P } S { Q } is partially correct if every terminating computation of S starting from a P -state ends up in a Q -state. Definition 2.17 { P } S { Q } is called totally correct if every computation of S starting from a P -state terminates and ends up in a Q -state. The Hoare calculus proves the correctness of programs with a syntax- driven axiomatic system. The Hoare System consists of the following axioms and rules: Skip statement: { P } skip { P } Assignment statement: { P t } v ← t { P } v where P t describes the state P except that v has the value of t . v Composition rule: { P } S 1 { R } { R } S 2 { Q } { P } S 1 ; S 2 { Q } Conditional rule: { P ∧ B } S 1 { Q } { P ∧ ¬ B } S 2 { Q } { P } if B then S 1 else S 2 { Q } Loop rule: { P ∧ B } S { P } { P } while B do S { P ∧ ¬ B }</region>

This system is only able to prove partial correctness. In order to prove total correctness, it is necessary to adapt the loop rule: Loop rule 2: { P ∧ B } S { P } { P ∧ B ∧ ( t = x ) } S { t &lt; x } P ⊃ t ≥ 0 { P } while B do S { P ∧ ¬ B } Notice that t is an integer expression and x is an integer variable that is not part of P , B , t or S .

Definition 2.21 The weakest precondition wp ( S, Q ) is the set of initial states, described by a predicate, for which S terminates and Q is true on termination. In contrast to the axiomatic Hoare logic the termination is inherent in the definition of pre- and postconditions. Proposition 2.22 A program S is correct with respect to the predicates P and Q if P ⊃ wp ( S, Q ) . Weakest preconditions satisfy the following properties:</region>

Related work In general there do not exist many comparisons in the style of this thesis. Special impact on this work had Griffioen and Huisman [1998]. They compare PVS and Isabelle by implementing some examples and investigating the logics behind these tools. They come to the result that both tools are very powerful, but also have some weak points. They give advice on how to combine both tools to obtain even better proofs. Zolda [2004] compares Isabelle and ACL2 and points out the different approaches. He comes to the conclusion that both tools have a lot of functionality but need a good background in logic. Freining et al. [2002] compare FPP with NPPV and SPARK. NPPV and SPARK have advantages in special tasks, but FPP is the winner in the specified test environment.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="86" confidence="possible" page="20" column="1">The Frege Program Prover, from now on called FPP, was developed at the University of Jena, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Programming Languages and Compilers.

FPP is an experimental system, implemented as a web application, for analysing the semantics of programs and for performing correctness proofs of annotated programs. FPP supports a subset of Ada — the concrete FPP syntax can be found at psc.informatik.uni-jena.de/Fpp/fpp-synt.htm . Identifiers are assumed to be integer or boolean variables. FPP offers various capabilities:</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="88" page="20" column="1">Computation of the weakest precondition FPP computes the weakest precondition for a given program statement S in combination with a given postcondition Q . The internal mechanism is mainly based on the calculations of weakest preconditions as presented in section 2.5. <marker type="block"/> Check for the correctness of a program Given a precondition P , a program S and a postcondition Q , FPP checks whether the Hoare triple { P } S { Q } is consistent. Such a triple is called consistent, if the program S satisfies the conditions stated by the precondition P and the postcondition Q . Hence FPP checks consistency by testing</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="94" confidence="possible" page="21" column="1">For checking the correctness of a program, FPP needs to perform mathematical proofs. This is done with an extended version of Analytica (confer Clarke and Zhao [1993], Bauer et al. [1998]). FPP does the translation between the input program written in a subset of Ada into a representation that Analytica can handle. In the next step Analytica tests the Hoare triple on validity and returns the result. As Analytica is a main part of FPP for checking the correctness, it will be shortly presented. Analytica Analytica is an automated theorem prover, originally intended for elementary analysis. It is written in the Mathematica programming language, which is based on term rewriting. In fact each step executed by Analytica is the application of a rewriting rule. Mathematica provides a rule-based programming language. Mathematica rules are of the form Pattern op Body with op being one of = , := , -&gt; or :&gt; . The Pattern part describes a class of expressions, where a rule is applicable. The Body defines the expression to which the left side should be rewritten. Rules are either eager or lazy rules (depending on the op operator), specifying the details of the rewriting process. For details on this process look up a good book on term rewriting (e.g. Baader and Nipkow [1998]). Analytica works in four phases: Skolemisation, simplification, inference and rewriting.</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="98" page="21" column="1">Skolemisation ∃ quantifiers are replaced by ∀ quantifiers. Within this translation it is necessary to consider free and bound variables and to introduce new function symbols. This is necessary to guarantee that the original formula is only satisfiable iff the skolemised formula is satisfiable. <marker type="block"/> Simplification Simplification is considered the most important step in Analytica. Simplification of a formula is executed in a so-called proof context. The proof context describes those formulas that may be assumed true during the simplification process. Analytica features various powerful rules to reduce the complexity of formulas.<marker type="block"/> Inference The inference phase is based on a sequent calculus as already presented in section 2.3. To Analytica rules have been added to provide easier handling, but the theoretic concept is the same.<marker type="block"/> Rewriting Rewriting implements those concepts presented above for Mathematica. Various tactics are available.</region>

The online address for this project is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" href="http://www.key-project.org/" id="102">http://www.key-project.org/</ext-link> . According to Ahrendt et al. [2004], KeY allows to write formal specifications and to verify those specifications in the context of UML based software development. In detail the KeY tool consists of and uses:</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="105" page="22" column="1">Basis CASE tool KeY is an extension to UML CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools, mainly the commercial Together Control Center from the Borland Software Corporation. An integration in the Eclipse Java development environment is under construction. <marker type="block"/> OCL constraints OCL is short for Object Constraint Language (cf. OMG [2003a]). It is used to specify constraints on objects in the Unified Modelling Language (UML). UML is in the meantime an accredited and recognised standard in object-oriented software development processes (cf. OMG [2003b]). KeY uses OCL to define the formal specification. KeY supports the user in creating and analysing OCL constraints and offers especially:</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="106" confidence="possible" page="22" column="1">Creation of OCL constraints KeY is able to generate automatically constraints by using design pattern instantiations. For standard formulations predefined instantiations of design pattern exist and can be easily used. On the other hand the user is free to formulate any valid OCL statement without assistance of KeY. Formal analysis of OCL constraints Constraints on classes which affect other constraints are automatically recognised and their relations between each other are analysed irrespective of implementation details. Verification of implementations From the given OCL constraints KeY can prove whether an implementation satisfies obligations. This way KeY can verify programs.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="110" page="23" column="1">JavaCard The target language of KeY is JavaCard. JavaCard is a subset of the widely used Java programming language — both developed by Sun Microsystems — with some restrictions, tailored for applications with smart cards that need a secure environment. A description of the JavaCard language is described in Sun Microsystems [2003] and is not given in this document as it is very similar to the well-known Java programming language.</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="112" confidence="possible" page="23" column="1">Architecture KeY consists of various components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="111" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref>):</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="117" page="23" column="1">Modelling component As already mentioned, KeY allows the user to create, process and analyse OCL constraints. This component handles this task. The CASE tool is responsible for modelling and rendering UML elements, whereas KeY uses external tools to manipulate OCL constraints. In addition OCL specification templates are available in this component. <marker type="block"/> Verification middleware KeY internally uses a dynamic logic for JavaCard, which will be explained below. The verification middleware does now the translation of the OCL constraints, the JavaCard program<marker type="page" number="24"/><marker type="block"/> code and the UML model in this JavaCard dynamic logic. This is then the input to the deduction component and hence connects the two layers modelling component and deduction component. Furthermore the proofs are managed and stored in this component.<marker type="block"/> Deduction component Based on the proof obligations resulting from the verification middleware, the deduction component tries to find proofs and discharge the proof obligations. The prover is interactive, but is designed to prove as much as possible automatically.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="118" confidence="possible" page="24" column="1">JavaCard Dynamic Logic Within KeY it is possible to specify preconditions, postconditions and class invariants. KeY allows now to check whether those assertions are valid after the execution of an implementation. The logic behind this procedure is a dynamic logic adapted for the JavaCard programming language. Dynamic logic can be seen as an extension to classical Hoare logic that was already introduced in section 2.4. As presented in Ahrendt et al. [2004, p. 11 ff], deduction in this dynamic logic uses symbolic program execution and program transformations. The dynamic logic is built from non-dynamic standard logic with some modal logic extensions. For every program statement in JavaCard an equivalent statement in JavaCard dynamic logic can be found — KeY has an 100% JavaCard coverage. Similarly dynamic logic statements can be found for OCL constraints, as the complexity of OCL is not as high as the complexity of the whole JavaCard programming language. Once the proof obligations have been collected, and all OCL and JavaCard statements have been transformed into the JavaCard dynamic logic, a deductive calculus is used: This calculus uses techniques like those presented in section 2.3, and is kind of sequent-style calculus. All in all there are about 250 rules as a lot of constructs need to be considered. Some examples are:</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="120" page="24" column="1">Active statement rules As JavaCard allows different scopes and blocks, it is useful to restrict the computation to only those program statements that have some impact on the further program execution. Then these statements are called active. <marker type="block"/> Assignment and update rules The idea is the same as in classical Hoare logic, but object-oriented programming style adds some difficulties. Typically assignments on objects are not as trivial as some references might need to be considered. Special rules were introduced to manage this problem in an efficient way.</region>
          <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="page_nr" id="121" page="24" column="1">23</outsider>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="123" confidence="possible" page="25" column="1">Exception rules JavaCard encourages the use of try-catch-finally and exceptions, which are no issues in standard sequent calculus. Again rules that deal with this issue were added. Taclets KeY introduced the principle of taclets in theorem proving: “A taclet combines the logical content of a sequent calculus rule with pragmatic information that indicates when and for what it should be used.” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="122" class="deo:Reference">Ahrendt et al., 2004</xref>, p. 14]. Taclets are considered powerful enough for theorem proving in combination with a relatively simple and convenient way for the user to write them. An excellent excursion to the topic of taclets can be found in Beckert et al. [2004].</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="126" confidence="possible" page="26" column="1">The Perfect Developer system, abbreviated PD, was designed and developed at Escher Technologies Ltd. in England. The main online reference is http: //www.eschertech.com/products/index.php . PD claims to be a tool for developing software systems that can be verified automatically. As a result a typical development process with PD should incorporate various phases:</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="132" page="26" column="1">• The user starts with a formal definition of functional requirements, where typical definitions deal with safety properties and expected behaviours. <marker type="block"/> • Based upon this a formal model can be elaborated. Diagrams in the Unified Modelling Language (UML) are supported. This allows the user to specify behaviour in a standardised way, enabling broader use and common understanding. Abstract data and abstract operations are defined, non-determinism is reduced to its minimum. Many times this leads to executable models in a very early development phase of the standard software engineering process.<marker type="block"/> • The formal model from the previous phase can now be checked against requirements. The requirements can be stated easily in form of preconditions, postconditions, invariants and other assertions within PD.<marker type="block"/> • Once the model has been built to encompass all necessary requirements, the next step is to refine the model to an implementation. PD can generate code directly from the specification. Another way is to specify a separate implementation that is checked against the model. The implementation includes concrete data structures and executable statements of varying complexity.<marker type="block"/> • After passing the previous steps the result is a model and an implementation. Verification of the model against the implementation reveals either errors, incomplete and inaccurate specifications or guarantees valid program code.<marker type="block"/> • As a final step code for target platforms can be generated. There are C++, Java and Ada available. This allows the code to be used on virtually any important operating system or hardware platform.</region>

In fact an enumeration is a class in PD, with operators for finding the lowest, the highest values, predeces- sor and successors. <marker type="block"/> User defined classes Object-oriented principles are implemented in a rigorous way: From abstract to final classes, single inheritance, polymorphism and dynamic binding are supported.<marker type="block"/> Class templates PD offers six structures for different well defined uses: sets, bags (multi-sets), sequences, pairs, triples and mappings. Map- pings define a relation between elements from the input domain to the output range. Typical applications are lookup tables or relational data- bases. Numerous operations on these structures are built-in, as well as rich theories for proving assertions about them.<marker type="block"/> Unions PD allows to combine types to build others. The standard example are strings, which are just character sequences in the PD language. Another example are lists of some type in combination with void rep- resenting the end of the list or the null value in other programming languages.<marker type="block"/> Operator and function overloading As PD supports template mechanisms, PD can easily build distinct signatures for overloading operator or function symbols. This ensures type safety with user-friendly naming conventions.<marker type="block"/> Partial functions Within the typed logic partial functions with equality or arithmetic behaviour are possible. Functions are either interpreted, possibly-interpreted or uninterpreted.<marker type="block"/> Expressions Within PD a lot of expressions exist: Quantified expressions, type widening expressions, type enquiry expressions, heap expressions, conversion expressions, scope resolution and ? as a shorthand for not yet specified behaviour.

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="143" confidence="possible" page="27" column="1">The PD Prover With the ongoing development of Perfect Developer the internal mechanisms were upgraded. At the beginning PD was influenced by approaches of Floyd and Hoare and the calculation of weakest preconditions (see sections 2.4 and 2.5).</region>
          <outsider class="DoCO:TextBox" type="page_nr" id="144" page="27" column="1">26</outsider>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="145" confidence="possible" page="28" column="1">Based on this approach a sequent calculus prover system was introduced. A further improvement was the use of a Rasiowa-Sikorsky deduction system. The main inference rules are:</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="146" page="28" column="1">Primary prover inference rules Those rules unify terms, expand functions or create meta-variables. In addition there exist manifold rules for standard connectives of the PD first order logic.</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="147" confidence="possible" page="28" column="1">Term creation rules like transitivity rules are subject to this topic. Hard-coded rewrite rules Other rewrite rules The next version of PD already used a resolution procedure and paramod- ulation with intense help of the built-in term rewriter component. The term rewriter is made up of two sets of rules:</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="149" page="28" column="1">Hard-coded rules Rules that are frequently used belong to this group or rules that simply cannot be parameterised. <marker type="block"/> Parameterised rewrite rules The larger set of rules is part of this group. The spectrum varies from rules with different operands to rules with preconditions.</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="150" confidence="possible" page="28" column="1">The language of PD has the power of first order predicate calculus with some additional higher-order constructs. The prover is basically able to prove classical two-valued logic, what implies that higher-order logic statements are transformed first. Additional rules are necessary for object-oriented features, like polymorphism or dynamic binding. Perfect Developer is also strongly influenced by the Verified Design-By- Contract principle: Verified Design-By-Contract The Verified Design-By-Contract idea is build upon the principle of Design-By-Contract. Design-By-Contract can be characterised as a system of preconditions and postconditions that have to hold for a given program. The implementations differ regarding the degree of formalisation:</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="154" page="28" column="1">Comments Comments state conditions in the source code. The problem is that these conditions cannot be automatically checked as they are just comments to the compiler. <marker type="page" number="29"/><marker type="block"/> Annotations with run-time checks Special statements in the programming language generate code that does not influence the effect of the program but check invariant conditions during run-time. This allows the user to find errors in the testing phase.<marker type="block"/> Annotations with static analysis It would be optimal if the compiler (or prover) could check the conditions before the program is even executed.

The Perfect language is powerful enough to write expressive conditions ( ∀ and ∃ constructs exist within Perfect) such that the behaviour of a program can be exactly defined. As a result code should just serve as an implementation to the specification. Often it is not even necessary to provide code because PD can construct executable code from the single specification. This ensures maximum consistency between code and its behaviour described in the specification. A more detailed explanation of (Verified) Design-By-Contract can be looked up in Crocker [2004b], Crocker [2004a], Crocker [2003b] and Crocker [2003a]. They discuss the topics presented here in a far more detailed way and should be consulted for deeper insight.</region>

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="157" page="30" column="1">3.5 PVS Specification and Verification System</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="159" confidence="possible" page="30" column="1">The Prototype Verification System PVS was developed at the Stanford Re- search Institute. The main project address is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" href="http://pvs.csl.sri.com/" id="158">http://pvs.csl.sri.com/</ext-link> . PVS is a prototype system for writing specifications and constructing proofs. PVS offers an expressive high-order logic in combination with semi- automatic proving. Hence user interaction is often necessary. PVS appears to the user as an extension to the common “Emacs” editor. The main components are:</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="161" page="30" column="1">Type-checker The high-order logic in PVS is strongly typed. The type- checker has to enforce those restrictions on variables and other program structures. The conditions generated for this job are called type correctness conditions (TCCs) in PVS. <marker type="block"/> Proof checker This component is the main part of PVS. Specifications are proved under consideration of TCCs and preconditions. The proving phase in PVS is implemented as a life-cycle process (cf. Owre et al. [1992, p. 3]):</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="163" confidence="possible" page="30" column="1">Exploratory phase The main objective is to provide meaningful output to the user in order to support the user in finding errors or improving the specification. Development phase Once the specification is fixed the proof goes into some more details. Very important is the efficiency of the proof development. Presentation phase The proof is prepared to be presented to the user. This requires the system to produce good and meaningful explanations to the user. Generalisation phase Once the proof is finished, the next aim is to weaken its precondition. This might strengthen the proof by providing a more general statement. Maintenance phase Maintenance is an extension to the idea of generalisation. This implies for the proof that its precondition may change. Therefore it might be necessary to redo parts of the proof to adapt to the new situation. The PVS Language The lexical structure of the PVS language can be found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30" id="162" class="deo:Reference">Owre et al., 2001a</xref>, p. 7]. In addition the PVS Specification Language offers numerous powerful features:</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="168" page="31" column="1">Type declarations Available are uninterpreted, interpreted and enumer- ated types and subtypes. <marker type="block"/> Variable declarations PVS interprets variables as logical variables, not as program variables. As a result it is possible to use binding expressions such as FORALL , EXISTS or LAMBDA .<marker type="block"/> Constant declarations As PVS supports high-order logic the term constant applies to any n -ary function. Normal constants can be seen as 0-ary functions. As in type declarations, constants can be uninterpreted or interpreted.<marker type="block"/> Recursive definitions Recursive definitions are allowed in PVS, but it is necessary to give PVS information on termination. The user has to define a MEASURE function that decreases strictly on recursive calls.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="176" page="31" column="1">Inductive definitions It is possible to define a function or behaviour (e.g. predicate) in an inductive style. Some restrictions have to be guaranteed — for details refer [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30" id="170" class="deo:Reference">Owre et al., 2001a</xref>, p. 23 ff].<marker type="block"/> Formula Declarations Formulas are very important in PVS. Formulas can either be axioms, assumptions, lemmas, theorems or obligations (and many more). With them it is possible to describe the behaviour of programs in the specification.<marker type="block"/> Conversions Conversions are inserted automatically by the type-checker subcomponent, as soon it appears to be necessary.<marker type="block"/> Types PVS offers complex types, subtypes, function types, tuple types, record types and dependent types.<marker type="block"/> Expressions For the PVS Specification language various expressions are defined. The semantics of the structures is similarly to any other functional programming language. For an exact specification look at [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30" id="175" class="deo:Reference">Owre et al., 2001a</xref>, p. 43 ff] and Owre and Shankar [1999].</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="182" confidence="possible" page="32" column="1">Theories Specifications in PVS are built from theories, that may be parameterised. The reason for theories was to provide maximal modularity and code-reusability. The grammar in an extended Backus-Naur form for the PVS Language is defined in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30" id="181" class="deo:Reference">Owre et al., 2001a</xref>, p. 83 ff, Appendix A]. The Logic of PVS The rules presented here are the theoretical background for the prover. Those rules are implemented in an efficient way but the idea works in the same way as presented here: PVS internals heavily use sequent calculus. For propositional logic a short outline was given in section 2.3. The notation introduced in section 2.3 conforms with the notation used for PVS high-order logic sequent calculus. The main connectives that PVS provides and hence need to be considered are: ¬ NOT ∧ AND &amp; ∨ OR ⊃ IMPLIES =&gt; ⇐⇒ IFF &lt;=&gt; ∀ FORALL ∃ EXISTS λ LAMBDA All rules presented in section 2.3 are basis for the sequent calculus in PVS. Furthermore there are:</region>

Quantifier Rules: Γ , A t ∆ x ( ∀ -l) Γ , ( ∀ x : A ) ∆ Γ A a , ∆ x ( ∀ -r) Γ ( ∀ x : A ) , ∆ Γ , A a ∆ x ( ∃ -l) Γ , ( ∃ x : A ) ∆ Γ A t , ∆ x ( ∃ -r) Γ ( ∃ x : A ) , ∆ with A t means that in A all free occurrences of x are substituted by a term x t (with possible renaming of bound variables). This way it is guaranteed that no free variables in t are captured, what is necessary for a correct high-order calculus. a has to be a new constant. Conditional Rules: Γ , IF ( A, B [ b ] , B [ c ]) ∆ Γ , B [ IF ( A, b, c )] ∆ Γ IF ( A, B [ b ] , B [ c ]) , ∆ Γ B [ IF ( A, b, c )] , ∆ Γ , A, B ∆ Γ , ¬ A, C ∆ Γ , IF ( A, B, C ) ∆</region>

At first the criteria are defined to build a common evaluation platform. Second, the systems are evaluated according to this criteria. Third, the examples are presented and, finally, the result of the verification process of each tool is discussed.</region>
        <section class="DoCO:Section">
          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="190" page="35" column="1">4.1 Criteria</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="191" confidence="possible" page="35" column="1">Criteria define the specific context and environment for practical tests. Thus it is relevant to specify them in a detailed way in order to provide a reproducible test scenario. Tests of verification tools often end up in a single final result. All invested work is aggregated to the completion of a selected case study. During the evaluation of the criteria for this work, the decision to incorporate the whole process — from the problem formulation to the final proof — was taken. In fact this is similar to the idea mentioned in Bundy [2004]. As already mentioned in section 3.1 on page 17 our target groups are:</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="193" page="35" column="1">Software engineers with a good knowledge of computer science but without specific training in formal methods <marker type="block"/> Students of computer science and software engineering in the middle of their studies, being confronted with formal verification tools for the first time.</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="194" confidence="possible" page="35" column="1">Criteria were chosen to test the capabilities in context for this target groups. The criteria are divided up into two categories:</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="195" page="35" column="1">Program related criteria This set of criteria is applicable for the whole verification tool and not restricted to specific examples. The defined criteria are as follows:</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="199" page="36" column="1">Problem related criteria These criteria make more sense to be looked at in a context for a specific problem.</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="200" confidence="possible" page="36" column="1">Ease of problem formulation Here is discussed, whether the problem can be formulated in a natural and short way. Complex problem formulations are the first step for the introduction of errors and need to be avoided as far as possible. Complexity of user interaction Does the system prove programs automatically? How often is it necessary to give hints to the prover or adapt the specification? How difficult is it to adapt the specification? Degree of coverage Is it possible to prove a correct specification under all conditions? Support in finding errors During the development process no user starts with a perfect specification. To which extent the system can help the user in finding problems or invalid specifications is relevant at this point. It should be clear that some criteria are interchangeable within both categories under different test scenarios. In fact, the result of this test should encompass all criteria, and should lead to more insight in the specific advantages and disadvantages of each tool. The criteria are deliberately neither rated nor weighted, as the impact of the various criteria differ too much under different scenarios. The plan is to give a comprehensive idea of how these tools work and which purpose they fulfil, not a ranking with winners and underdogs.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="287" page="53" column="1">Commercial or academic nature KeY is of academic nature. The tested version of KeY uses a commercial CASE tool, but the KeY prover component can be used separately. Future version will probably use Eclipse which is freely available. <marker type="block"/> Supported platforms and portability Official supported platforms are Linux, Solaris and Windows. Portability of the written code is given as long as a Java compiler exists on the platform. For most modern operating systems this should not be a problem and hence good portability is attested here.<marker type="block"/> Installation The installation is quite a complex task: KeY uses Borland Together Control Center as the basic CASE tool, what means extra installation. Together CC is not freely available in general (there exist evaluation and academic versions) and the installation process was tricky. It took some time to get KeY working.<marker type="block"/> General support The KeY team offered excellent support. As the tested version of KeY was still in alpha stage, help was quite often required, as some subcomponents were not implemented or did not work without modifications. At each point the KeY team gave support and did a great job in helping with verifying the examples. The support was a highlight in the work with KeY.<marker type="block"/> Code generation As the code is written in JavaCard, a standard Java compiler can build code. This avoids manual error-prone translation, making the whole process more secure.<marker type="block"/> Learning curve The familiarity with the widely used Java language probably helps many users in working with KeY. OCL constraints are relatively simple and can be learnt in a short time. A problem was the lack of documentation — but this is acceptable if a tool is still officially considered in alpha stage.</region>

            <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="293" page="54" column="1">Analysis Ease of problem formulation The problem can be formulated very easily in a procedural style in the Java syntax. The pre- and postconditions can also be stated in a clear manner according to the syntax of OCL constraints. A problem was that OCL does not support real numbers, which led at first to an exception. It was necessary to bring the factor 4 to the left side in the @postconditions otherwise the result would be typed as real according to KeY. But in fact this can never happen due to the internal structure of the formula. Complexity of user interaction The amount of user interaction is unfor- tunately very high. The induction rules for the while construct are complex and tricky. Only with a lot of tricks from the KeY team we could reproduce the whole proof. Without such help it is really hard, what makes the life not easier for a standard software engineer. Degree of coverage After a lot of tricks and with a lot of knowledge from the user KeY could verify the correctness of this program. <marker type="page" number="55"/><marker type="block"/> Support in finding errors As good the general support from the KeY team was, as intricate we found the reports and output from KeY. The integration of the KeY prover within the Together CC CASE tool and the fact that the prover has a graphical user interface are for sure good ideas, but the realisation was very confusing. It is hard enough to prove a correct program — finding errors from that is even harder with no special knowledge on the internals of the KeY prover.</region>

The generated code of PD is either Ada, C++ or Java and hence runs on any supported platform for these programming languages.<marker type="block"/> Installation The installation process is clear and well documented. On the officially supported platforms standard installation mechanisms pre- pare the system in order to start working immediately with PD. For Windows and certain recent Linux distributions the installation is automatic and is finished within minutes. For other Linux distributions some additional work may be necessary. PD, in particular the graphical user interface, relies on very recent versions of some libraries, which for instance are not available in the stable release of Debian Linux (woody) by default. Backporting and recompiling the libraries solves the problem.<marker type="block"/> General support Escher Technologies, the producer of PD, runs a mailing list, where questions of any nature were answered often within one or two days. The support is fast and competent.<marker type="block"/> Code generation The standard target languages of the automatic translation of the Perfect language are C++ and Java. So virtually any deployed operating system has support for at least one of these languages. So portability issues are not worth being further discussed.<marker type="block"/> Learning curve PD offers a lot of features, that take time to learn. For programmers not familiar with declarative or functional programming it might be a challenge to formulate programs in a non procedural way. Once the user has internalised the language structure the user is able to express specifications and programs in a concise and natural way.</region>

PVS is a specification language integrated with support tools and a theorem prover. So the code has to be written in the specification language, which then can be verified. A translation of such algorithms into real code is still necessary. <marker type="block"/> Learning curve PVS is hard to learn. PVS offers many possibilities during the proving phase. How and when to use them requires not only inten- sive training with PVS but also a profound knowledge of logic. PVS is highly interactive, advanced knowledge is definitively necessary.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="454" confidence="possible" page="80" column="1">The last two sections compared in detail the four selected tools: section 3 presented the tools from a theoretical point of view, whereas section 4 discussed the implementation of several examples to illustrate the differences and capabilities. This section summarises the results with respect to the two target groups, namely software engineers and students of computer science with a limited background in formal logic.</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="464" page="80" column="1">Frege Program Prover FPP supports a small subset of Ada consisting of typical imperative program structures like loop, case- and if-statements. The only data types available are integer and boolean. The language for specifying pre- and post-conditions is rather restricted. E.g., function definitions, recursive specifications and structured data types like arrays are not supported. FPP is able to verify simple programs and to compute their weakest pre-conditions. The prover, Analytica, acts as a black box signalling either the validity of a formula or returning unprovable sub-formulas; formal proofs are not supplied. Due to its simplicity and its web interface, FPP is easy to learn and use. It seems to be a valuable tool for illustrating the ideas of formal program verification in basic courses. It is not suitable, however, for advanced courses on the subject or for real world applications, as it is neither able to deal with standard examples from Gries [1989] and Dijkstra and Scholten [1990] involving arrays, nor does it support object-oriented features. Moreover, the terse output in pure ASCII makes it difficult to trace errors. <marker type="block"/> The KeY system The KeY system supports a subset of Java known as JavaCard, which is increasingly used for mobile and embedded devices. Verification is based on dynamic logic, a generalisation of the Hoare calculus. The system is integrated into a professional CASE tool (Bor- land’s Together Control Center); an integration into the free Eclipse environment is under way. Objects and constraints can be specified using UML and OCL. Java, UML, OCL, and CASE tools are familiar to software engineers and students alike, which helps in getting started. Nevertheless, KeY cannot be recommended for these target groups at present: the interactive prover and its interaction with the user are in their infancy (compare the example in section 4.4.2) and are inadequate for any se-<marker type="page" number="81"/><marker type="block"/> rious use. Moreover, OCL is not expressive enough to specify complex program behaviour. Considering that KeY is still in alpha stage, it seems to be worthwhile to reevaluate the system in a few years in order to see whether it lives up to expectations.<marker type="block"/> Perfect Developer PD consists of a full-fledged object-oriented programming language, Perfect, of a powerful automated theorem prover and of a code generator translating programs from Perfect to Java, Ada, and C++. A rich collection of built-in data types, classes, functions and theories allows the user to write concise specifications on a fairly abstract level. PD is a technically mature product that is ready for use in a regular development process. However, software engineers will need some time to become sufficiently acquainted with the many features of Perfect. Moreover, at least a basic knowledge of formal logic is required to be able to interpret the prover output and to use it for detecting errors in the specification or in the program. Perfect Developer is also well suited for teaching advanced courses on formal program verification. Usually there will not be enough time to cover all features of Perfect. Therefore a tutorial is required that concentrates on just those elements of the language that are necessary to implement and verify instructive examples like those in Gries [1989]. PD is the only tool of the four that comes close to the ideal of automatic and easy program verification. But there are also still some shortcomings. One is that the prover currently does not support induction. Consequently certain recursive functions and loops cannot be verified by the system. Another weakness, at least from an academic point of view, is the lack of information concerning the inner workings of the prover. Ideally the logical rules used in correctness proofs should be open for inspection such that independent proof checkers can establish additional trust in the system.<marker type="block"/> Prototype Verification System PVS is a powerful interactive theorem prover, which has been used for various real world applications. In contrast to the other systems it does not generate verified program code, but proves properties of algorithms. The prover is versatile and offers many possibilities. It is automatic to a certain degree, but usually requires frequent user interactions. Due to its many basic inference rules and tactics it takes a long learning<marker type="page" number="82"/><marker type="block"/> phase to become familiar with the system. Moreover, users of PVS need a firm background in mathematics and formal logic to guide the prover. In our opinion typical software engineers and average students of computer science will have a hard time using PVS. Graduate or Ph.D. students might have a chance, provided they are given enough time. For courses with just a few hours per week in the lab PVS seems to be too complex.</region>

Tools for formal software verification have made considerable progress in recent years. With the advent of tools that offer formal methods on a level accessible to software engineers the costs for formal software verification will decrease such that it will be used in more and more projects. Universities have to react already today by training students in formal methods, using one or the other system.</region>
