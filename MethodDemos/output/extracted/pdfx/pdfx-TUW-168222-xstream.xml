  <title>Interlocutor Informative Speech</title>
  <abstractText>— Recent research results on communication science mention a relation between the interlocutor’s perceptional preferences, his or her mental representations and his or her choice of expressions. However, there is not any tool for analyzing such. In my research I combined lexical with computa- tional linguistic methods to develop a software prototype that is able to analyze text on the usage of perceptional expressions. This analyzing tool can help to identify the interlocutor’s perceptional preference for easier meeting his or her way of thinking and thereby facilitate the understanding.</abstractText>
