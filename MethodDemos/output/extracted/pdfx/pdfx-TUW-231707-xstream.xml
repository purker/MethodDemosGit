VRVis is located in the TechGate building in Vienna, Austria, and has an annual budget of around 5 million Euros from which mainly around 65 researchers are paid. The VRVis Research Center is set up as a non-profit-making limited company which is owned by universities and many companies. Currently VRVis is organized in three areas, which are Rendering, Visualization, and Visual Analytics. Each area performs some five to ten projects, most of which are multi-firm projects, that means that more than one company contributes to its budget.</abstractText>
