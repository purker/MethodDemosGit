      <abstract class="DoCO:Abstract" id="3">Translating clinical practice guidelines into a computer-interpretable format is a challenging and laborious task. In this project we focus on supporting the early steps of the modeling process by automatically identifying conditional activities in guideline documents in order to model them automatically in further consequence. Therefore, we developed a rule-based, heuristic method that combines domain-independent information extraction rules and semantic pattern rules. The classification also uses a weighting coefficient to verify the relevance of the sentence in the context of other information aspects, such as effects, intentions, etc. Our evaluation results show that even with a small set of training data, we achieved a recall of 75 % and a precision of 88 %. This outcome shows that this method supports the modeling task and eases the translation of CPGs into a semi-formal model.

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="18" page="1" column="1">Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are defined as “systematically developed statements to assist practitioners and patient decisions about appropriate health- care for specific circumstances” [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="5" class="deo:Reference">6</xref>]. They include recommendations describing appropriate care for the management of patients with a specific clinical condition. An important part of CPG contents refers to the procedures to perform, often formulated together with specific conditions that have to hold in order to execute an activity. CPGs are published as textual guidelines, but in order to deploy them in some kind of computerized tool (e.g., a reminder system or a more complex decision- support system) they have to be represented in specialized languages (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="6" class="deo:Reference">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="7" class="deo:Reference">7</xref>] for a comparison and overview). Although different authoring/editing tools are often associated with these languages, authoring is a labor-intensive task that requires comprehensive knowledge in medical as well as computer science. There have been several approaches to ease the modeling process, amongst others by introducing intermediate representations that provide more semi-structured and less formal formats. One of them is MHB, the Many-Headed Bridge<marker type="page" number="2"/><marker type="block"/>  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21" id="10" class="deo:Reference">21</xref>], that tries to bridge the gap between the guideline text and its corresponding formalized model. It falls in the category of document-centric approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22" id="11" class="deo:Reference">22</xref>] and is devised to produce a non-executable XML document with the relevant CPG fragments, starting from the original text. The knowledge of a CPG is thereby represented in a series of chunks that correspond to a certain bit of information in the CPG (e.g., a sentence, part of a sentence, more than one sentence). The information in a chunk is structured in various dimensions, e.g., control flow, data flow. To additionally support the modeling task for non-IT experts, MHB was further developed and split into MHB-F (free-text version) and MHB-S (semantically enriched version) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="12" class="deo:Reference">19</xref>]. MHB-F now provides a very simplified structure to make the modeling even for non-IT experts feasible and to leave modeling details to knowledge engineers in a later step. In order to ease the laborious modeling, parts of the task should be automated by applying information extraction methods. In this work we will focus on the identification of condition-action sentences that form a prominent aspect of the process flow in CPGs. The discovery of such combinations is not a trivial one. On the one hand, condition-action sentences are rarely of the form ‘ if condition then action’, but require more sophisticated identification methods. On the other hand, conditions may refer to effects, intentions, or events and not activities, and these combinations have to be sorted out by our method. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" id="13" class="deo:Reference">Table 1</xref> shows a few example sentences in regard to their MHB-F aspects.<marker type="page" number="3"/><marker type="block"/> In order to identify condition-action sentences we propose a rule-based method using a combination of linguistic and semantic information. Furthermore, we in- troduce a weighting coefficient called relevance rate (rr) that shows whether a sentence is relevant for modeling. The following section gives a short overview on the usage of information extraction methods as well as knowledge-based approaches for guideline modeling. Our method is explained in Section 3 and subsequently evaluated and discussed in Sections 4 and 5.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="29" page="3" column="1">Guideline developers edit CPGs in a free-text format. In order to transform the medical knowledge described in a guideline into execution models a translation process is required. Moser and Miksch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="20" class="deo:Reference">14</xref>] detected prototypical patterns in free- text guidelines to bridge this gap. Serban et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="21" class="deo:Reference">18</xref>] proposed an ontology-driven extraction of linguistic patterns to pre-process a CPG in order to retrieve control knowledge. The evaluation showed that the modeling as well as the authoring process of guidelines was supported. Language engineering methods were used in SeReMed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="22" class="deo:Reference">5</xref>] to detect diagnoses or procedures in medical documents. The method was successfully applied to X-ray reports. These documents however, show a standardized structure and therefore are easier to handle by knowledge engineering methods than CPGs. Taboada et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23" id="23" class="deo:Reference">23</xref>] identified relationships between diagnoses and therapy entities in free-text documents by matching the core information units of a sentence with a collection of predefined relationships but the quality of this matching was not rated. To implement a rule based approach to recognize medical entities the MeTAE (Medical Texts Annotation and Exploration) platform was used by Abacha and Zweigenbaum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="24" class="deo:Reference">1</xref>]. Additionally, semantic relations between each pair of these entities were identified by means of MetaMap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="25" class="deo:Reference">2</xref>]. Consequently, relations between a problem (e.g., disease) and a corresponding treatment were found. The method was applied to selected arti- cles and abstracts of PubMed but not to CPGs. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="26" class="deo:Reference">8</xref>] a heuristic-based approach using information extraction methods independent of the final guideline repre- sentation language was defined. This method was implemented and applied to several guidelines containing a high amount of semi-structured text. The adop- tion of this methodology on ’living-guidelines’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="27" class="deo:Reference">9</xref>] showed promising results. A set of semantic patterns representing activities based on semantic relations was generated by Kaiser et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="28" class="deo:Reference">10</xref>] to identify medical activities in CPGs. Its effectiveness was proved by a study which showed that a large part of control flow related aspects could be identified. The relation between the activity and a corresponding condition, however, was not part of the method but is an important requirement for the future automatic translation of a guideline.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="54" page="5" column="1">For the development of the general linguistic pattern set we used a chapter from an Asthma guideline developed by SIGN [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="47" class="deo:Reference">17</xref>], where chapter 4: pharmacological management had been modeled in the semi-structured modeling language MHB- F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21" id="48" class="deo:Reference">21</xref>] by a guideline modeling expert. We analyzed this chapter with regard to the control flow aspects and started generating an initial linguistic pattern set based on trigger words (12 occurrences for ’if’ and 4 occurrences for ’should’).<marker type="block"/> In order to identify the semantic clauses of a sentence (these are the parts describing the condition and the consequence ), the patterns had to be grouped into 6 different patterns for ’if’ and 4 different patterns for ’should’ (some straightfor- ward patterns are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" id="52" class="deo:Reference">Table 2</xref>). Condition and consequence are distinguished according to the sentence’s syntax, punctuation and its sequence of phrases. Two complex examples including conditions spread over multiple phrases are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" id="53" class="deo:Reference">Figure 2</xref>. We assigned a weighting factor to every pattern of the set - the value 0.5 to show that only a trigger word was found and 1.0 to express that also the semantic clauses were identified. These constants can be adapted for new rule types in the future.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="71" page="7" column="1">The relevance rate rr is a measure to find out whether a sentence contains a condition-action combination. Furthermore, it shall classify a sentence as crucial for the clinical pathway in contrast to other information aspects like intentions or explanations which are modeled in MHB-F in a different way. To find this semantic difference the syntax of the sentences as well as their containing medical semantic types must be respected. In order to calculate the relevance rate for a selected sentence its semantic abstraction has to be generated and compared with every entry in the semantic pattern pool. If the rule type and the semantic clause type are matching, the similarity of the sequences of the semantic types is calculated by using the Dice coefficient [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="69" class="deo:Reference">12</xref>]. The highest value is selected for further calculation.<marker type="block"/> In general, the value of the relevance rate rr is the sum of – the weight( w ) of the applied general IE rule, and – the sum of the maximum similarity value ( s i ) for each semantic clause of the sentence divided by the number of semantic clauses ( n ) identified by the general IE rules.</region>

The similarity value s i of the semantic clause of a sentence and a matching entry in the semantic pattern pool were calculated as follows: – If the semantic clause contains only one semantic type it is compared to those entries of the semantic pattern pool that also show only one semantic type (to receive a better accuracy). In the case that both types are equal the value for s i is set to 1.0, otherwise – both sequences of semantic types are interpreted as a string each and two sets of 4-letter string bigrams are composed out of them. Subsequently, these two sets are used for the calculation of the Dice coefficient. <marker type="page" number="8"/><marker type="block"/> Example : Given are the sequence of semantic types of a new semantic clause S and the sequence of semantic types of a matching entry of the semantic pattern pool P .</region>

Twenty out of the 50 sentences had been modeled in MHB as control flow related aspects (activities based on special medical conditions) and therefore their rr was expected to be higher than 1. The other 30 sentences represented information about intentions and explanations in MHB with an expected rr lower or equal 1. The evaluation results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5" id="95" class="deo:Reference">Table 5</xref> differentiated by the rule types.<marker type="block"/> With the described method it was possible to identify 15 sentences which correctly contained control flow related aspects. Only two sentences got an in- correct rr higher than 1. They were not correctly rated, because they did not describe condition-based activities. Other 5 sentences got an rr lower than 1 although their rr should have been higher as they contained condition-based activities. Thus, the method had a recall of 75% and a precision of 88% (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6" id="99" class="deo:Reference">Table 6</xref>).

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="108" page="11" column="1">Generally, the results proved that the rules of type “if” showed much better results for the precision (93%) and the recall (82%) than the ones of type “should”. Nevertheless, the negative predictive value for the latter type showed a rate of 93%. The analyzed guidelines contained 7 sentences with control flow related information but they were not classified because their patterns did not exist in the Asthma guideline. Consequently, no corresponding general linguistic IE rule existed in the pattern pool. An extension of the general linguistic pattern set with rules for the trigger words “when”, “could” and “in case of” should be taken into consideration. Additionally, 1 condition based activity could not be found, because the semantic information was distributed over more than one sentence. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7" id="107" class="deo:Reference">Table 7</xref> selected examples are shown with a relevance rate lower or equal than 1.0 together with the corresponding reasons. Even though only a small amount of training data (16 sentences) was avail- able from the Asthma guideline, our method identified condition-based activities for control flow related aspects in a guideline document. Furthermore, it showed that the combination of domain independent information extraction rules and an automatically created semantic pattern pool leads to valuable results.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="111" page="11" column="1">The aim of this paper was to develop a method to identify condition-action sentences. By defining a set of linguistic patterns we split up sentences semantically - from one selected training guideline - into their clauses showing the condition and the consequence. We used the UMLS Semantic Network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="110" class="deo:Reference">13</xref>] to find out which types of medical concepts were applied in these clauses. The outcome was a semantic abstraction of every training sentence which then was stored in a semantic pattern pool. This pool facilitated the classification of new sentences regarding to their relevance to the corresponding MHB-F model expressed by the measure relevance rate ( rr ).</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="112" confidence="possible" page="11" column="1">Modeling experts benefit from the method in two ways:</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="118" page="11" column="1">1. Condition-based activities in free-text guidelines, which must be modeled in MHB-F, are identified and rated. 2. These sentences are automatically split into the condition and the resulting activity. <marker type="block"/> An integration of the presented method into modeling tools will ease the work of all parties involved. Ongoing steps will be (1) the implementation of additional information extraction rules to expand the general linguistic pattern set in order to improve the hit rate; (2) the extension of the semantic pattern pool with additional training data in order to increase the significance of the relevance rate; (3) the application of the method in the context of ’living-guidelines’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="114" class="deo:Reference">20</xref>]; (4) an investigation,<marker type="page" number="12"/><marker type="block"/> whether this method can support the modeling of processes also in other application areas by substituting the UMLS SN by other domain dependent thesauri; (5) the refinement of information extraction rules to make a step towards an automatic translation of condition-based activities of free-text guidelines into the modeling language MHB-F; and (6) the development of case studies to evidence the effectiveness of the method in real-world scenarios. If it is possible to tap the full potential of the presented method, the implementation of CPGs will be fostered tremendously.<marker type="block"/> Acknowledgement.
