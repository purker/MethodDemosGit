      <abstract class="DoCO:Abstract" id="5">This paper describes our submission to the MIREX 2006 Audio Music Similarity and Retrieval task. The task was to submit an audio feature extraction algorithm, to compute music similarity measures and to return a distance matrix from an audio collection consisting of 5000 pieces, which was subsequently evaluated through human listening tests as well as objective statistics. We submitted a new implementation of the Statistical Spectrum Descriptor (SSD) audio feature extractor and computed the distance matrix directly from feature space. Results from the human evaluation show that our approach is among the top 5 algorithms which furthermore show no statistically significant performance differences. The evaluation of a number of objective statistics ranked our algorithm 3rd in most of the cases. Our submission was one of the two fastest in terms of total runtime, having the shortest distance computation time. The approach has also been evaluated on Audio Cover Song Identification, where it was the best-performing “Audio Music Similarity and Retrieval” submission, outperformed, however, by 4 submissions which were specifically designed for the cover identification task.</abstract>

Even new problems arise as research advances, demonstrated by both the number of new ideas in the annual ISMIR confer- ences and the changing set of tasks within MIREX. However, for some of the “tasks” even the “problem” is not defined clearly, as for example the concept of music similarity may be employed for different things such as playlist</region>

Regardless of this open issue, MIREX is well established as the forum for annual exchange within the research community and evaluation of algorithm performance for a range of different tasks and approaches the MIR community is faced with, and that researchers are currently working on. Our department has a strong background on information retrieval with a focus on data visualization and clustering of data, e.g. on Self-Organizing Maps. As “Department of Software Technology and Interactive Systems” we are also developing applications for interaction with data, such as music and text archives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="10" class="deo:Reference">1</xref>]. Besides the traditional focus on unsupervised clustering of archives, we furthermore investi- gate machine learning approaches for classification of data collections, for tasks such as music genre classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="11" class="deo:Reference">2</xref>]. In any of these areas efficient feature extraction from audio is required and therefore we are as well active in research on audio feature extractors. MIREX is a great opportunity for us to evaluate the audio features we employ in our applications and to compare them with state-of-the-art algorithms, both in terms of efficiency with regard to similarity as well as in terms of runtime requirements.</region>

After much discus- sion on the MIREX mailing list, the human listening test has been realized as follows: 60 songs were randomly selected as queries from the total of 5000 songs in the database. Each participating algorithm had to return the 5 most similar songs to the query (after filtering out the query itself, members of the cover song collection, as well as songs of the same artist as the query, in order to avoid the task to be an artist identification task). The results from all 6 participating algorithms then formed a list of 30 results per query, which was evaluated by human graders, who rated each retrieved song on two scales: one broad scale, stating whether the song is not, somewhat or very similar to the query song, and one fine-grained scale, where they had to score the retrieved songs on a real-value scale between 0 (not similar) and 10 (very similar). Each query result list has been evaluated by 3 different graders. 24 graders participated in the human evaluation, hence each person had to evaluate 7-8 query result lists. The listening test was performed through the spiffy Evalutron 6000 web interface 2 .</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="36" page="2" column="2">A new application that we are working on created the need to re-implement the feature extraction algorithms, that we previously implemented in Matlab (and that we used for the MIREX 2005 Audio Genre Classification task [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="31" class="deo:Reference">3</xref>]) namely Rhythm Patterns, Statistical Spectrum Descriptors and Rhythm Histograms - in Java. The newly created feature extraction software is able to extract the three feature sets from .au, .wav and .mp3 files and offers a number of new convenient methods over the previous Matlab implementation: e.g. recursion of arbitrary directory hierarchies containing any number of audio files and the mixed usage of different file formats and sampling rates (11, 22 or 44 kHz) within one feature extraction process. Some parts of the feature extraction algorithm(s) had to be implemented in slightly different ways, which was the main reason why we wanted to participate with the new Java version in the large scale evaluation of MIREX 2006. Another benefit of the Java implementation is that it is more robust than the Matlab implementation. If an error occurs for a particular file, the program outputs a meaningful message, skips the file and continues with the next audio file. (In this case that audio file would not be included in the final distance matrix). To overcome some of the frequent (MIREX) pitfalls we also tested it with silence in audio (without problems) and checked for NaN’s, etc. Initially we wanted to submit a combination of several feature sets, similar as in our MIREX 2005 submission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="32" class="deo:Reference">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="33" class="deo:Reference">2</xref>]. However, from preliminary tests with similarity retrieval, computing distances within the vector space, we found that the Statistical Spectrum Descriptors (SSD) de- liver reasonable results. As the computational cost for ex- tracting SSD is lower than as for both Rhythm Patterns and Rhythm Histograms, and the dimensionality is lower than the one of Rhythm Patterns (which reduces the cost for distance calculations), we decided to base our submission solely on the SSD features. The following paragraphs describe the implementation of the SSD feature extraction. Statistical Spectrum Descriptors are derived from a psycho-acoustically transformed Bark-scale spectrogram and comprise several statistical moments, which are in-<marker type="page" number="3"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> tended to describe fluctuations on a number of critical frequency bands. Before calculation of the features, the audio file is seg- 18 mented into chunks of approx. 5.9 seconds ( 2 samples 17 16 @ 44 kHz, 2 @ 22 kHz, 2 @ 11 kHz). The first and the last segment are skipped, from the remaining segments, every third one is processed. An SSD feature vector is cal- culated for each of the remaining segments. First the spectrogram is computed using the short time Fast Fourier Transform (STFT) (window size: 1024 @ 44 kHz, 512 @ 22 kHz, 256 @ 11 kHz) and 50 % overlap. The Bark scale, a perceptual scale which groups frequen- cies to critical bands according to perceptive pitch regions, is applied to the spectrogram. The Bark scale is defined by limits within the audio frequency region, partitioning the frequency spectrum into 24 critical bands. Using 22 kHz audio as input, the number of bands is 23 only. Frequency bands from the spectrogram are aggregated to the bands defined by the Bark scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="35" class="deo:Reference">5</xref>]. The Bark scale spectrogram is then transformed into the decibel scale. Subsequently, the values are transformed into Sone values, in order to approximate the loudness sensation of the human auditory system. From this representation of a segment’s spectrogram the following statistical moments are computed in order to describe fluctuations within the critical bands: mean, median, variance, skewness, kurtosis, min- and max-value are computed for each critical band, forming the SSD feature set. The feature vector for an audio file is then constructed as the median of the SSD features of the extracted file segments.</region>

However, neither the testing nor the implementation of different distance measures had been completed at the time of the MIREX submission deadline. Therefore we submitted a script, that passes the feature vector file written by the Java Audio Feature Extraction software to Matlab, and compute the distance matrix directly from the vector space using the cityblock metric. The Matlab function then writes the distance matrix to the file format specified on the MIREX task web page.</region>

The Friedman test was chosen because it is a non-parametric test which does not assume a normal distribution of the data. The Friedman test has been performed in Matlab with pairwise comparison of algorithms for each of the 60 queries, based on the fine-grained score.

This might be the reason why the ordering of the results from these statistics partly differs from the one from human listening results. Figures 2 and 3 present the results of the percentages of how many within the retrieved 5 respectively 20 most similar songs have the same genre, artist or album as the query song. The numbers have been computed excluding the 330 cover songs and considering normalization for genres, artists or albums with less than 20 matches available in the database. The genre statistic is given before and after filtering out the query artist. The measurement of artist- filtered statistics is important, because many algorithms de- tect songs from the same artist as the most similar songs and unfiltered results evaluate mainly the capability of algorithms to identify artists. Further statistics for the top 10 and top 50 results are available from the Audio Music Similarity and Retrieval Statistics result webpage 5 .
