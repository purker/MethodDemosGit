      </section>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="24" page="1" column="1">To date, the use of new technologies increased in the treatment of several mental disorders, including: obsessive-compulsive disorders [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="6" class="deo:Reference">1</xref>] schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="7" class="deo:Reference">2</xref>], eating disorders (EDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="8" class="deo:Reference">3</xref>], and anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="9" class="deo:Reference">4</xref>]. Furthermore, additional virtual reality approaches have been successfully applied by minor mental disorders, such as: posttraumatic stress disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="10" class="deo:Reference">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="11" class="deo:Reference">6</xref>] and addictive behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="12" class="deo:Reference">7</xref>]. As previously stated, computer games, could serve as an additional form of treatment in several areas, such as: schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="13" class="deo:Reference">8</xref>], asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="14" class="deo:Reference">9</xref>], and motor rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="15" class="deo:Reference">10</xref>]. Although, several naturalistic studies have shown the usefulness of serious videogames for enhancing: positive attitudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="16" class="deo:Reference">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="17" class="deo:Reference">12</xref>], problem solving strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="18" class="deo:Reference">13</xref>], and modifying abnormal behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="19" class="deo:Reference">14</xref>], there is a lack in the literature of specially designed serious-games for treating mental disorders and of controlled studies. Based on the current difficulty to treat some specific areas (e.g. some personality traits, attitudinal and emotional aspects,<marker type="page" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> impulsivity), in Eating disorders (ED) and Pathological gambling (PG), even after using evidence based psychological therapies, the purpose of Playmancer was to create and design a serious videogame that may help to treat these factors. Hence, the purpose of this presentation is to introduce the current state of this innovative research, showing the design of the study and preliminary results. The final goal of this research is to analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of using a serious videogame, as additional therapy tool, for treating mental disorders (namely ED and PG), when compared with a comparison group, where no additional videogame has been used.</region>

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="26" page="2" column="1">1.1. Type of study and participants</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="27" page="2" column="1">A prospective longitudinal cohort study (patients and controls), following a quasi- experimental design, is being used. 60 Bulimia nervosa and 60 PG patients are participating in this study. All of them fulfill DSM-IV criteria for those pathologies.</region>

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="28" page="2" column="1">1.2. Procedure</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="31" page="2" column="1">Psychometric and physiological measures administered previous to treatment, at the end of treatment and at 3 and 6 follow-up, will be used for the assessment of therapy outcome. All cases will be assigned to two conditions: standard cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) + weekly videogame vs. CBT without videogame. <marker type="block"/> Videogame: The 3D environment videogame to be used, “Islands”, which is being created and developed within the European research project PlayMancer [16], to modify underlying attitudinal, cognitive, and emotional processes of specific mental disorders. Islands may help to improve the player’s, relaxation, planning skills and self- control strategies.<marker type="block"/> Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): The specialized CBT program will be composed of 16 individual out-patient weekly sessions, of manualized and validated program.</region>

        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="32" page="2" column="1">2. Results</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="33" page="2" column="1">In this presentation, we have introduced PlayMancer , and shown preliminary results of a first pilot trial. The PlayMancer platform relies on a modular architecture and brings together state of the art techniques from multimodal interaction, 3D engines, speech, and facial emotion recognition. An association between video gaming and physiological and emotional reactions of users will be demonstrated.</region>

      <section class="deo:Discussion">
        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="34" page="2" column="1">3. Discussion</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="36" page="2" column="1">The potential of serious games has been demonstrated thoroughly from both a research and a business standpoint. It seems that in last years, serious games have experimented <marker type="page" number="3"/><marker type="block"/> a steady growth of complementing treatments in the health area, and it seems that well- produced games for health can lead to informational and potentially behavioral improvements for their players. Despite this, there are few specifically designed studies for treating specific traits in mental disorders. With the Playmancer video-game, new interaction modes are provided by newly developed components.</region>

      <section class="deo:Conclusion">
        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="37" page="3" column="1">4. Conclusions</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="38" page="3" column="1">Playmancer is an innovative approach, developed by multidisciplinary team, for linking physiological, emotional and behavioral reactions of mental disorder patients. The preliminary results of a pilot trial will be shown.</region>
