      </title-group>
      <abstract class="DoCO:Abstract" id="5" confidence="possible">The diagnosis of failures in train traffic installations can be done in sev- eral ways: direct observations and measurements, software assisted diagnosis using specific software packages, process variable monitoring for electronically centralized installations. This work presents basic concepts for Model Based Diagnosis (MBD) that uses fuzzy logic to analyse the integrity of Centralized Traffic Control Installations (CTC) in train traffic. We define the diagnosis relations to be used and show how to apply them to train traffic security installations. Implementing these concepts into an expert system assists maintenance operators in quick failure diagnosis of the train traffic security installations.

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="13" page="1" column="1">Railroad Centralized Traffic Control installations are very complex systems that command and control train traffic, being essential in train traffic security. Train stations where the CTC installation is electro-dynamically realised (ED-CTC) have more complex subsystems, each of them, again, having subcomponents that inter- act with each other. Each subsystem interacts with other subsystems, therefore the safety of the traffic passing an ED-CTC station is ensured when all subsystems function within normal parameter values. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="7" class="deo:Reference">Fig. 1</xref> shows the interconnection block schema for a railway station with CTC and ABS (Automatic Block Signalling) installations. All subsystems are controlled through the command console, any failure of the one or more subsystem causing an irregular behaviour of the whole system, behaviour which is usually signalled. Diagnosing the system or the subsystem is necessary in order to detect the failing component(s) that are the cause of the faulty behaviour. Currently, for these types of installations, the failure diagnosis is done by direct observations of the various signals and measurements of equipment states.<marker type="page" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> The diagnosis time strongly depends on the maintenance staff’s detailed knowledge on the whole system and subsystems internals.<marker type="block"/> This work proposes to develop an expert system (ES) that uses fuzzy logic to diagnose CTC stations. ESs are used also in power electric systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="12" class="deo:Reference">1</xref>]. The expert system will receive information from various subsystem components and will process and compare them with the ES model. The ES output will be a minimal set of causes for the signalled system misbehaviour, corresponding to the signals displayed.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="17" page="2" column="1">To better understand the basic principles in the model based diagnosis we will use the word system to refer to both systems and subsystems. To use the model based diagnosis it is necessary to completely describe each system component. This step is called system description, SD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="15" class="deo:Reference">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="16" class="deo:Reference">2</xref>]. Logical relations that describe how the components work, the links between components, and the workings of the whole system are established. These relations are, in fact, propositional logic sentences that form the system’s propositional logic, SPL . A logical consequence of the detailed and correct system description is the correct operation of the system. Any discrepancy between the system’s punctual behaviour (pointwise) and its description is caused by a faulty component. Thus the system description is based on the logical propositions that describe the components, their operation and the links between them. To diagnose a system we must identify all the discrepancies between the system description and its running behaviour. Each discrepancy (or symptom) is de- termined by a set of concurrent components, CC, which are candidate components for the respective symptom. We can write:</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="22" page="3" column="1">An example of a defect, in our case, is the fact that an entry signal cannot be commanded on the ‘free’ position. The concurrent components of this symptom are: damaged track circuit, damaged track point, faulty power feed installation, line occupied by rolling stock, previously executed movement on the same line, damaged command apparatus. Based on observations it is noted that the system failure is caused by the track circuit which does not function properly. In this case the main candidate components are: safeties, transformers, IMVS, BDF, TR relays, the track relay, the filter, the railway tracks, connections, ropes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" id="21" class="deo:Reference">Fig. 2</xref>).</region>

We continue with some further basic definitions and relations in the model based diagnosis systems. The CD’s operation state is described by a predicate, AB, which indicates the abnormal operation (faulty state). The normal operation state is given by ¬AB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="27" class="deo:Reference">2</xref>].
