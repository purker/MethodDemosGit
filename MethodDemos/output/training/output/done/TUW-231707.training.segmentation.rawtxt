ABSTRACT: The VRVis Research Center in Vienna is the largest technology transfer 
institution in the area of Visual Computing in Austria. The requirements of the funding body 
FFG include the publication of scientific research results in first class peer reviewed media, and 
the active cooperation with co-funding companies. As a consequence the requirements on the 
staff of VRVis are manifold: they have to communicate with real users, use real data, know 
about software and hardware, understand the market, do professional documentation, initiate 
new projects and write funding proposals for these, be part of the scientific community and 
publish and review papers, manage several projects in parallel and obey strict deadlines for their 
projects and some more. Such staff is barely available and must be trained on the job. 

1 INTRODUCTION 

Visual Computing helps for many applications, often it provides visual solutions to data 
intensive problems. However, academic research often solves problems suspected by the 
researchers, rather than problems that appear in industry. The VRVis Research Center is set up 
to solve real problems from the real world, which is mostly less spectacular in the pure scientific 
sense, but it leads to practically useable results. This sort of research is not less demanding, 
however seen as second class research by many academics. For the researchers themselves it is 
rather more difficult than academic research, because the goal cannot be changed to avoid 
complications. In addition, VRVis researchers need to have numerous other "non academic 
qualifications". 

2 THE VRVis RESEARCH CENTER 

The VRVis Competence Center (VRVis 2014) was founded in 2000 funded by the Austrian 
Kplus program, and since 2010 it is funded by the Austrian COMET program as a K1 center. Its 
mission is to perform research and development in Visual Computing and bridge the gap 
between science and industry with translational research. VRVis is located in the TechGate 
building in Vienna, Austria, and has an annual budget of around 5 million Euros from which 
mainly around 65 researchers are paid. 

The VRVis Research Center is set up as a non-profit-making limited company which is owned 
by universities and many companies. Currently VRVis is organized in three areas, which are 
Rendering, Visualization, and Visual Analytics. Each area performs some five to ten projects, 
most of which are multi-firm projects, that means that more than one company contributes to its 
budget. 

3 THE UNDERSTANDING OF INNOVATION 

In theory there is a common understanding how innovation happens. Scientists and researchers 
investigate the unexplored world and produce publically accessible publications and patents. 
This process is mostly done at universities and public research institutions. Then developers in 
companies make use of these findings and results to produce solutions for the real world, stable 
products for the world market. In large companies often additional research is added, the results 
of which are mostly protected by patents immediately, or they are kept secret altogether. 

In practice this innovation chain rarely happens that way. The research results from academics 
have assumed ideal conditions, non-realistic constraints and flawless input data, so that an 
additional step is necessary to adapt such results to realistic requirements. This step is larger 
than many scientists are aware of, and it justifies specialized translational research institutions 
such as VRVis, AIT, Fraunhofer, and others. In close cooperation with developers from 
companies, these institutions have the competence to adapt pure research results to the 
requirements of the real world, and the people working there need special skills to perform these 
tasks. 

4 REQUIREMENTS ON TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH STAFF 

In addition to the necessity to perform first class project work, i.e. to meet the defined project 
goals, researchers at a translational research institution such as VRVis need to be able to cope 
with a variety of additional challenges. These are partly due to the real life conditions, and 
partly because the overall requirements exceed those of pure research. 

4.1 Communication with Real Users 
Dealing with people from outside the field of computer science uncovers the use of different 
languages for the same things, and the complexity of some aspects that seem simple for the 
computer scientist. Often the user describes a problem and her/his envisaged solution in the 
idealistic world of her/his realm. The project leader misunderstands parts, and adds new ideas 
based on her/his knowledge of technical possibilities. The programmer interprets these 
requirements based on her/his personal experience and attitudes and produces something the 
user believes is wrong. Only during this last discussion it turns out that the first description by 
the user was incomplete, the interpretation by the project leader went in the wrong direction and 
the creativity of the programmer (and possible errors in the code) produced an unusable result. 
Coping with this situation is a challenge in its own. In addition some users misunderstand the 
options and possibilities, and also all users (and scientists, of course) are different characters, 
that don't always fit together. 

4.2 Use of Real Data 
Idealized test data are always created optimally so that the foreseen variations of an algorithm 
work fine. Data from the real world is erroneous, incomplete, inexact, includes many exceptions 
to the defined rules, and, above all that, is often huge, much larger than the algorithm was 
intended for. Especially the adaptation of functioning and published state-of-the-art algorithms 
to extreme data sizes is a main research topic for VRVis researchers. 

4.3 Hardware and Market Knowledge 
Researchers operating under realistic conditions need to be experts with all the various hardware 
they use. Many fast algorithms have to be implemented with hardware dependent components 
to ensure low level optimization. Today not only the large amount of companies creates many 
different interfaces, but also the immense variety of special hardware components. To make 
optimal use of these, it is also necessary to keep an overview over new product developments, 
hardware trends and announced products. Visiting technical exhibitions and fairs, reading 
computer journals and watching announcements in electronic media are necessary and expected 
activities. 

4.4 Project Initiation and Proposal Writing 
New projects don't come by themselves. VRVis researchers are also experts in generating new 
projects. They need to be aware of all funding opportunities and know how to write a successful 
funding proposal. Based on intensive contacts with many companies they must also 
communicate the functioning of a translational research institution to these. For the proposals 
they need to be aware of the state-of-the-art of their science field and of the intended application 
field. They have to be trained in project planning, including time and budget plans. And they 
have to be experienced and consequent to collect the proposal parts the company partners have 
to deliver in time! 

4.5 Scientific Publishing 
Evaluators of any research institution are often pure academic researchers. Their main 
evaluation criterion is then scientific output, i.e. the number and quality of produced scientific 
publications. Therefore, VRVis researchers have to fully understand this aspect and be able to 
write scientific publications that will be accepted at high quality media. This includes knowing 
where to publish, knowing the scientific state-of-the-art, and giving good talks at conferences. 
But it is also a challenge to get the o.k. from companies to publish at all, and to judge any con-
flicts such a publication might have with patents or other intellectual property rights involved. 

4.6. Professional Documentation 
As opposed to usual scientific results which are produced for one time demonstration of the 
correctness of a result, software or system components intended for practical use need to be 
accompanied by understandable and complete documentation and user manuals. In addition, 
companies involved in a project often require training sessions for the people who either will 
use the results or who are involved in strategic decisions at the company. Thus it is necessary 
that the programmers and project leader maintain the user view of their products -not always 
easy when you are deep into the details. 

4.7 Multi-tasking under Time Pressure 
Projects for the real world also have real deadlines. University scientists are used to extendible 
deadlines, flexible result progress, and no concrete consequences in case they miss these. Only 
submission deadlines at conferences generate some stress, but again, no severe consequences 
other than postponing the result to the next available publication option occur. In contrast, when 
cooperating with companies there are project contracts, fixed deadlines and there is little 
compromise accepted for the results. This increased time stress is accompanied by nervous 
roommates, noise, telephone calls, emails, reviews, guests, continued education, project 
initiations, and many more disturbing factors. It needs special concentration to be able to work 
under such conditions. 

5 CONCLUSIONS 

Translational research is a challenge in its own, often underestimated by academic scientific 
staff. Besides excellence in computer science involved researchers need to have various 
valuable skills not taught in usual university courses. Thus the value of a research organization 
depends even more on its well selected employees and the relevant skills learned on the job than 
on any other aspect.
